09/21/2024: commenters say it's too salty (both the overnight brine and the glaze),
so i think i will reduce the amount of both.

9/22/2024: made this tonight and it was very good, but the texture of the pork 
wasn't what i would like (i pulled it out after 6 hours, and it definitely wasn't
collapsing, or easily shreddable). i made several subs and changes, so let's get
those out of the way first:

* used 1/4 cup of kosher salt and white sugar for the rub
* used rice vinegar instead of sherry vinegar
* puréed the ginger-scallion sauce (and added more soy sauce and rice vinegar to 
  make it thin enough to blend)
* didn't have ssamjang, so doubled kochujang and used 1 tbsp. of black bean sauce
* used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. salt for the rub, mostly a powder on top
  and browned for 5 minutes instead of 15

next time i would:

* either get ssamjang or use a lot more gochujang to make the sauce spicer, and
  reduce the oil a lot
* cube the pork, toss with salt/sugar mix, and cook in a crockpot
* mix with brown sugar and broil to make a bark
