8/28/23: made these as bar cookies in a 9x13" glass dish, but they were still underbaked when the
top was browned. so either covering with foil to prevent over-browning, or halving the recipe and
using an 8x8" for a thinner bar would be better.

2/27/26: baked from frozen, and 14 minutes at 350 was perfect.
