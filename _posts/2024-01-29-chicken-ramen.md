01/31/2024: made this using leftover
[peruvian roast chicken]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-22-peruvian-roast-chicken %}) and it
was great. it definitely needed more liquid than the original recipe, so i increased that. also, it
was fairly sweet (not in an unpleasant way), so i think i would decrease the mirin a bit (maybe 2
tbsp. instead of 1/4 cup?) next time.
