08/20/2024: made a variant of this which was very good:
* ground beef instead of turkey, and added cumin/chili powder/etc.
* used a can each of black beans and diced tomatoes instead of green beans and mushrooms
* scaled down cheese sauce to 3 tbsp. butter/flour, 1 5/8 cup milk, 1/4 cup heavy cream, and
  1 1/2 cups cheddar, and 1/2 cup shredded mexican cheese blend
* made a shallow 9x12" pan and a 6" pie dish without the cheese sauce
