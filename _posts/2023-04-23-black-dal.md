04/23/23: i misread the original recipe and so did not add extra water when adding the soaked urad 
dal, so it burned in the instant pot. i removed it to the stovetopand simmered for about 3 hours,
adding about 4 cups of water over time, before it was moderately tender.

01/13/25: switching to a rainbowplantlife recipe, since i've liked all of her recipes that we've
tried.
