**defrosting:**

* place in warmest part of the fridge for several days to fully defrost (lower section where we
  normally keep meat, drinks, etc. is too cold).

**brine:**

2 cups apple cider  
2 gallons cold water  
1 1/2 cups kosher salt  
1 cup brown sugar  
5 cloves garlic, crushed  
2 tbsp. peppercorns  
2 oranges, sliced  
2 lemons, sliced  
5 sprigs rosemary  
3 bay leaves
* combine all ingredients in large pot and bring to a simmer until salt and sugar dissolve
* cool to room temperature and use to brine turkey 18-24 hours

**smoke:**

10-12 lb. turkey  
1 onion, quartered  
1 lemon, quartered  
fresh herbs  
canola oil  
salt and pepper (or rub)  
* stuff turkey with onion, lemon, and herbs
* tie legs together with kitchen twine
* brush large pan with oil and place turkey in the pan with wings tucked under the body
* assemble big green egg with ceramic diffuser with pizza stone surface up, top with a baking rack,
  and finally turkey in roasting dish (do not put baking dish directly on pizza stone, this will
  bake the turkey from the bottom instead of smoking it)
* smoke at 250°F for 5-6 hours, until thermometer in thickest part of thigh reaches 165°F
* rest at least 15 minutes before carving and serving

11/25/2024: this turned out great this year and last. but both years, i put the roasting dish
directly on the pizza stone, resulting in the turkey cooking in about 2 hours instead of the
expected 5-6. this makes for a very hectic and early thanksgiving dinner. i added a baking rack
as a spacer, but it was too late. i think that i do that at the beginning next year, it will
successfully smoke the turkey instead of baking it.
