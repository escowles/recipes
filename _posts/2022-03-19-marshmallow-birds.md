**note:** i tried the marshmallow recipe from the first link, and it did not set,
even after waiting an hour (i piped the peeps out and they immediately collapsed
into pools of goo). but the recipe lacks even the basics of candy-making (no real
times or temperatures), so maybe some small change to what i did would fix it. the
martha stewart recipe works perfectly.
