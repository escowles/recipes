05/24/2023: i accidentally left out the coffee, and the cake had two flaws: it sank in the middle,
and it was not as red as i was hoping. i think adding the coffee would help prevent sinking, but
there were comments suggesting that reducing the oil to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup melted butter
would help, too. i might also just do cupcakes next time, because the cake is so rich that it's
easy to get too much. for the color, just adding a ridiculous amount of gel food coloring is
probably what is needed. doing cupcakes would have the advantage of making it easy to have some
with buttercream frosting and some with cream cheese frosting (since i like the cream cheese better
but Irina doesn't).

02/18/2025: trying an alternative recipe (https://www.southernliving.com/red-velvet-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting-7108652):
