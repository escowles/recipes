1 lb. spaghetti (n.b., not thinner pasta like angel hair)  
2 Tbsp. olive oil  
1 lb. italian sausage  
6 cloves garlic  
1 Tbsp. red pepper flakes  
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese  
3/4 cup chopped parsley  
1 tsp. salt  

  * Add spaghetti to 12" frying pan and cover with water. Add salt, bring water to a boil, then cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
  * Heat oil in large pan. Add sausage and brown 3-4 minutes per side, then remove from pan.
  * Add garlic to pan and saute for 3 minutes.
  * Add chili flakes and saute another 30 seconds.
  * Add 2Â¼ cups of pasta water to the pan, scrape up any brown bits from bottom of the pan. Bring to a vigorous simmer for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to low.
