2 eggs  
1¾ cup milk  
½ cup applesauce  
2 Tbsp. butter, melted  
1 Tbsp. sugar  
1 Tbsp. baking soda  
¼ tsp. salt  
2 cups flour  

* Beat eggs, then stir in remaining ingredients except flour.
* Add flour and mix until just combined, leaving lumps.
* Pour 1 cup of batter into waffle maker and bake according to waffle-maker instructions.

2019-03-09 13:33:33: Reduced butter variant:
* Reduce butter to 3.5 Tbsp.
* Add 1 egg and 4 Tbsp. (1/4 cup) canola oil to egg/vanilla mixture.

No noticeable difference in taste/texture. Batter was smoother and easier to pour
into waffle iron.
