* remove chicken from marinade and pat dry, then drizzle with oil
* bake at 450°F 35-45 minutes, until temperature reaches 165°F (if using parts, start breasts
  10 minutes after thighs to finish baking at the same time without over-cooking breasts)
* loosely cover with foil and rest 5 minutes before serving

3 jalapeños, roughly chopped (seed the peppers to reduce the heat)  
1 cup fresh cilantro leaves  
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped

1/4 cup sour cream  
juice from one lime  
1/2 tsp. salt
