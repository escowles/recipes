2 tsp. paprika  
2 tsp. sugar  
1 tsp. black pepper  
1 tsp. oregano  
4 lb. whole chicken or chicken parts

* coat chicken/parts in the marinade, then cover and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight
* remove chicken from marinade and pat dry, then drizzle with oil
* bake at 425°F 35-45 minutes, until temperature reaches 165°F (if using parts, start breasts

1 cup cilantro (1.5 oz.), large stems removed

1/4 tsp. salt  
1 tbsp. olive oil

  lime juice and salt to increase intensity

01/28/2024: the chicken was great, other than the drippings burning on the pan, so i reduced the
oven temperature. the sauce was too thin and not hot enough, so i upped the spice and reduced the
mayo.
