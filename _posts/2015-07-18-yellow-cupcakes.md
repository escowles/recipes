2 eggs  
2¼ cups flour  
2½ tsp. baking powder  
½ tsp. salt  
¾ cup unsalted butter, softened  
1¾ cups granulated sugar  
3 tsp. vanilla extract  
1 cup whole milk  

* Preheat oven to 350°F.
* Line a 12-count muffin pan with cupcake liners. This recipe only makes 16-18 cupcakes, so you will have 4-6 cupcakes to bake in a 2nd batch.
* Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together and set aside.
* In stand mixer, beat butter on medium speed until smooth and creamy (about 1 minute).
* Add sugar and beat for 3-4 minutes, scraping down with a rubber spatula as needed.
* Add eggs and vanilla, and beat until combined.
* Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and milk.
* Spoon batter into cupcake liners, filling halfway full.
* Bake for 18-20 minutes, until tops of the cupcakes spring back when gently touched, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
* Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.
* Top with [Milk Chocolate Frosting]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-07-18-milk-chocolate-frosting %})
