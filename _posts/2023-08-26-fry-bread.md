08/26/2023: the topping was great (kind of a cowboy chili), and the bread tasted good but was pretty
tough. i suspect that's because i over-kneaded and under-rested, resulting in too much gluten
formation and not enough relaxation. next time, try mixing dough until just combined and resting at
least 30 minutes. measuring flour by weight might also help, if the hydration ratio is off because
my flour-scooping is denser than expected.
