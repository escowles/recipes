04/21/2024: i made some version of this a few years ago, but didn't write the
recipe down. i remember the filling being too dry (which is often my issue with
tamales in any situation), hence topping with ranchero sauce.

04/23/2024: making some small adjustments — braising the pork took longer than expected and topping
pork with sauce did not work (the sauce just cooked in a puddle on top instead of sinking down into
the pork). also, switching to the dough recipe from my standard tamale recipe, since i think that
crisped up better.
