09/20/2024: some commenters added traditional spices (like nutmeg and cayenne) and noted that they
had problems with the macaroni curdling the eggs. but i'm going to make it as written, and think
the curdling would only happen if you don't rinse the pasta as directed.

09/24/2024: this was great, and the broiled cheese on top was particularly good. but cooling
everything down by rinsing the pasta meant that the cheese mixed with the macaroni didn't really
melt. next time, i think i will mix the cold pasta with the eggs, milk, butter, and cheddar, and
then heat it up until the cheese melts.
