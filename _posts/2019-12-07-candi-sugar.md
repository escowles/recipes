1 lb. sugar  
1/2 cup water  
1/8 tsp. cream of tartar  

  * Mix all ingredients in a saucepan and heat slowly to 260°F.
  * Hold between 260°F and 275°F for 20 minutes to invert sugar. **Note:** this is basically impossible to do on an electric stove.
  * (optional) Continue cooking between 260°F and 275°F to caramelize sugar for darker color.
  * To make syrup: pour out and let cool.
  * To make rocks: heat to 300°F and pour out onto foil-lined baking sheet and let cool.
