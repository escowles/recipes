**filling the keg:**

* fill the keg with a sanitizing solution, attach to beer and co2 lines, pressurize
  with co2, then push a gallon of sanitizing solution through the beer line.
* disconnect the keg, empty it, turn upside down, and let it air dry before filling.
* rack beer into keg (taking a small sample to check final gravity), lubricate seal,
  and close keg.
* attach to co2 line only, pressurize to 20 psi, and leave for 24 hours.
  optional: agitate occasionally to increase carbonation rate.
* depressurize keg, then repressurize to desired carbonation level (~10 psi) and test  carbonation, adjusting pressure to desired level.

**emptying the keg:**

* when the keg is empty, depressurize it and disconnect from beer and co2 lines.
* empty any tails and rinse well to remove any yeast or other sediment.
* fill with 1 scoop of oxiclean and 5 gallons of warm water, and agitate.
* attach to beer and co2 lines, pressurize, and then push a gallon of oxiclean
  solution through the beer line.
* depressurize and leave for 24 hours.
* open keg, pour out remaining oxiclean solution, rinse well, and air dry.
