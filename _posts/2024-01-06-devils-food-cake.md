01/18/2024: the cake was perfect, but the frosting was trouble (over-chilling according to
instructions made it split, so i had to melt it and re-mix) and didn't taste as good as i wanted
(not sweet enough, not chocolatey enough). it also made way too much for cupcakes.

02/04/2024: actually, i went ahead and found a couple of other frosting recipes that i think will
work better.

and, the cake went well again, but i remembered that it wasn't perfect like i said above - some of
the second batch of cupcakes fell in the center (they were perfectly domed coming out of the oven).
i think that leaving the frosting sit while the first batch are baking makes it get overmixed.

02/06/2024: the new frosting is perfect, so i'm moving those into the recipe. and everything
that i've read about falling cupcakes indicates that too little baking powder/soda and overmixing
are the most likely problems, so i've added some baking powder and added a comment about not
overmixing.
