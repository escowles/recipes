3 egg yolks  
5 Tbps. sugar  
1½ Tbsp. flour  
1½ Tbsp. cornstarch  
1¼ cups whole milk  
1 tsp. vanilla  

* In stand mixer, whisk together egg yolks and sugar just until pale yellow and creamy, then whisk in cornstarch and flour.
* In a medium saucepan, heat milk and vanilla on medium heat just to a boil. Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg mixture while whisking constantly until smooth.
* Transfer mixture back into saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly and vigorously so that the eggs won’t curdle, until mixture thickens.
* Remove from heat and transfer to a medium heatproof bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding to prevent it from creating a ‘skin’. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled.
