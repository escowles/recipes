2 Tbsp. olive oil  
18 oz. potatoes, peeled and diced  
salt and pepper to taste  
* heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet or dutch oven
* season and fry potatoes until golden and crispy, stirring occasionally (15-20
  minutes, covering the pan will speed it up)

6 oz. diced bacon  
1/2 onion, diced  
* add to pan and fry while stirring occasionally until bacon is crisp (10 minutes)

3 eggs  
1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or mexican blend)  
* make wells in the hash and crack an egg into each well
* add cheese around eggs and cook until whites are set and yolks are cooked to
  your liking
* serve immediately

08/15/2023: followed these instructions pretty closely (including covering potatoes for first 10
minutes) and they wound up tasty but not crispy. there was too much moisture for any real browning
to occur, and there was a ton of gunk caked on the bottom of my dutch oven. next time, i would
follow my usual [roasted potatoes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-12-20-roasted-potatoes %})
recipe, and add bacon and eggs for last 10-15 minutes.
