**clean bottles:**

* soak bottles in warm water, removing labels and rinsing out the worst of any 
  remnants.
* rinse bottles in oxiclean solution (1 scoop to 5 gallons of warm water), shaking to
  remove any hard-to-remove remnants.
* sanitize bottles in a star-san solution and let air dry.
* sanitize bottle caps, tubing, racking cane, bottling tip, and bottling bucket.

**prepare beer:**

* boil bottling sugar in 2 cups of water for 5 minutes.
* add sugar to bottling bucket, then siphon beer from the fermentor to the bottling
  bucket, taking care to minimize oxygen contact with the beer.
* take a small sample of beer before it goes into the bottling bucket to check the
  final gravity.

**filling bottles:**

* attach bottling tip and siphon beer into bottles.
* cap each bottle with a bottle cap and seal with capper.
* label caps to make it clear which batch it is (i number each batch i brew and
  write the number on the bottle caps with a sharpie).
* leave bottles at room temperature or cellar temperature for 2 weeks, then chill one
  bottle and test the carbonation.
