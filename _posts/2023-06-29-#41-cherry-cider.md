## fermentables:

2 gallons whole foods apple juice  
1/2 gallon Trader Joe's honeycrisp apple cider  
4 lbs. frozen montmorency cherries  

## yeast:

* Safale US-05 (1 envelope)

## intermediate stats (before cherries):

OG: 1.050 (06/29/2023)  (estimate, didn't check gravity and tilt didn't work)  
FG: 0.999 (07/09/2023)  
ABV: 6.1%  

OG: 1.063 (estimate based on 4 lbs. of cherries adding 0.013)  
FG: ??  
ABV: ??  

## process:

* no boil, just combine in sterilized 5-gallon fementing bucket and pitch yeast
* seal with airlock and ferment until gravity stabilizes (never actually saw
  bubbling because we were out of town, but gravity and taste confirms fermentation)
* cherries added after primary fermentation is complete:
  * heated from frozen over low heat until reaching 170°F
  * mashed with potato masher and held at 170°F for 20 minutes
  * covered and allowed to cool to room temperature before adding to cider
