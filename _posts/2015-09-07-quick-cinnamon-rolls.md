2015-09-07 08:41:08: A comment suggested some interesting modifications:
* Don't bother sprinkling any filling on bottom of the pan
* Cut them thick because they won't rise much
* Bake at 300°F to make the dough gooier
* Bake in spring-form pan to make it easier to get them out
* Pour melted butter over the rolls after removing from the oven
