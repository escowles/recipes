2020-06-17 17:20:36: Updated the recipe to reflect what I'm typically doing these
days:
* Refried beans instead of pinto beans
* Poblano peppers instead of bell peppers
* No tomato puree
* Left optional brown sugar and harissa, though I typically don't do these based on
  feedback.

2023-11-06: updated recipe again because i'm using chile powder (i.e. powdered
chiles) instead of chili powder (i.e. spice blend) and chile powder is a lot
hotter.
