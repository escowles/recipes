1 13.5 oz can full-fat coconut milk  
5 egg yolks  
1/3 cup sugar  
1/4 cup cornstarch (or tapioca flour)  
1 Tbsp. vanilla  

* Heat coconut milk in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.
* While the coconut milk is heating, add the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch to a medium bowl, whisking together until smooth.
* Whisk the coconut milk occasionally until it starts to steam - do not boil.
* Continually whisk the egg mixture while slowly pouring in the coconut milk.
* Return the mixture to medium heat, whisking constantly, until thickened (about 5 minutes).
* Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract.
* Pour into a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a crust from forming.
* Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
