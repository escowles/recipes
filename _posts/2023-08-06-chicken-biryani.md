8/6/2023: cooked rice on lowest flame for 10 minutes, and there was still water
above it. increased heat a tiny bit and cooked another 10 minutes, and it was still
not cooked. cooked another 10 minutes and it seemed cooked, so i rested for 15
minutes, but upon eating, it was a little too firm. the rice package recommended
bringing to a boil and boiling until the water was no longer above the rice, so i
might do that next time.

2/12/2023: much closer with current mods, but overspiced and missing something at
the same time. reducing chili powder, adding some garlic and cumin, and updating
instructions a bit.

09/02/2024: made this again last night and it was good other than needing to add more
water to get the rick to finish cooking (i've fixed the recipe). we also talked
about the flavor profile needing something, and here are some things that might help:
* using basmati rice instead of whatever rice i have on hand
* adding some chicken stock instead of some of water
* saffron
* turmeric
* anise
* adding some eggplant, peas, chickpeas, or other veggies

11/17/2024: made this again and got a much better flavor, but still had issues with the rice not
being cooked and having to boil off excess moisture. i probably need to use basmati rice for this
dish, so i've updated the recipe to reflect that and the changes i made last night:
* replacing 2 cups of the water with chicken stock 
* using all ground spices (other than caraway seeds)
* added some peas and broccoli
* adding coriander
* increasing lime juice

01/30/2025: updating with slightly reduced liquid and using a rice cooker as
suggested by some other recipes i looked at. made it this way and it was the best
i've ever made — though it was too much for the rice cooker, so i reduced the rice
and liquid to fit next time
more rice and liquid, which overflowed)
