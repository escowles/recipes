8/6/2023: cooked rice on lowest flame for 10 minutes, and there was still water
above it. increased heat a tiny bit and cooked another 10 minutes, and it was still
not cooked. cooked another 10 minutes and it seemed cooked, so i rested for 15
minutes, but upon eating, it was a little too firm. the rice package recommended
bringing to a boil and boiling until the water was no longer above the rice, so i
might do that next time.

2/12/2023: much closer with current mods, but overspiced and missing something at
the same time. reducing chili powder, adding some garlic and cumin, and updating
instructions a bit.
