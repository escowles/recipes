dough: [Cream Cheese Pie Crust]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-08-17-cream-cheese-pie-crust %})  
filling: double batch of [Empanada filling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-08-empanadas %})  
* I typically make a few changes because it's a larger batch, such as using one apple and one
  potato (not two potatoes) and adding some Worcestershire sauce instead of just doubling the
  soy sauce, etc.

**assembly:**

1 egg yolk  
1 tsp. cold water  
* Line quarter sheet pan with bottom crust, filling with empanada filling, then top with top crust.
* Beat egg yolk and water, then brush pie crust top.
* Bake at 425°F for 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F and bake an additional 35 minutes.
* Rest 10 minutes before serving.
