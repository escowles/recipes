2020-08-16 20:58:27: Differences:
* used drippings for onion/pepper/etc. additions because the pan didn't dry out
* did not use any adobo sauce
* used 1 can each of crushed tomatoes, black beans, and refried beans
* used 2 cups of chicken stock, boiled down to roughly the right consistency and
  steak was tough, so added another cup
