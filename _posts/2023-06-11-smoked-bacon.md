6/18/2023: smoked the pork belly for 2 hours, to about 167°F. it was flavorful with a little char
around the edges, but still a little tough (simmered in ramen for about an hour before it was very
tender). i have seen recommendations that going to 200°F would make it fall-apart tender, so i
might try that next time.

5/23/2024: grind the peppercorns and bay leaf to make them more uniform, and wrap the pork belly
like a brisket in order to protect the corners from drying out and getting tough.
