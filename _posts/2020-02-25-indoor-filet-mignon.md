 	<li>Sear each side for 2.5 minutes. Roll the edges in the skillet to sear them as well.</li>
 	<li>Put the skillet with the steaks in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven and roast for 5 minutes, or until a thermometer reads 135F for medium-rare.</li>
 	<li>Let the steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
