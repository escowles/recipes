  * Heat a cast-iron or oven-safe skillet on the stovetop until it's screaming hot.
  * Rub the steak tops and bottoms with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper.
  * Sear each side for 2.5 minutes. Roll the edges in the skillet to sear them as well.
  * Put the skillet with the steaks in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven and roast for 5 minutes, or until a thermometer reads 135F for medium-rare.
  * Let the steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving.
