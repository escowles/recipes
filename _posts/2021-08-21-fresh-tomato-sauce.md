5 lbs. tomatoes  
3/4 tsp. salt  
2 Tbsp. olive oil  
1 Tbsp. tomato paste or ketchup  
1 clove garlic  
1 sprig basil  
1 bay leaf  
* halve tomatoes and grate the flesh into a bowl (about 4 cups)
* add to a large pot with remaining ingredients, bring to boil
* reduce heat and simmer until reduced by half

for a thicker sauce: drain flesh in a mesh sieve and discard the liquid

for a smoother sauce: remove largest chunks with a slotted spoon, blend in blender,
  then return to the pot
