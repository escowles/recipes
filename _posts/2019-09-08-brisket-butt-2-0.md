<ul>
 	<li>Brisket, approx. 4-5 lbs.</li>
 	<li>Lump charcoal</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>Marinate brisket/butt overnight, see <a href="http://tfsh.us/memory/2015/08/22/brisket-marinade/">brisket marinade</a>, <a href="http://tfsh.us/memory/2013/05/05/mojo-chicken/">mojo marinade</a>, or just rubbed with salt. Rinse off salt and coat with <a href="http://tfsh.us/memory/2017/09/04/kansas-city-rub/">Kansas City rub</a>.</li>
 	<li>Fill egg with charcoal, light with firestarter, close lid with chimney uncovered to promote chimney effect, and wait until fire is well started, about 10 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Cover chimney with adjustable vent lid, and close down bottom and top airflow to regulate temperature, adjusting to about 250°F.  For most stable temperature, make a change and wait a few minutes to see the full effect.</li>
 	<li>Add the following to the smoker quickly to minimize oxygen allowed into the egg:  
<ol>
 	<li>plate spreader (feet up)</li>
 	<li>drip pan filled with 1L water</li>
 	<li>grill rack</li>
 	<li>brisket, fat side down</li>
 	<li>meat thermometer</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Smoke for a total of approximately 75 minutes per pound, opening lid as infrequently as possible.</li>
 	<li>When brisket/butt is around 170°F and the temperature has plateaued, remove and wrap in foil with ½ cup of liquid (beer, wine, broth, apple juice, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Continue smoking until temperature reaches 200°F.</li>
 	<li>Remove foil, reserving drippings for gravy if desired.</li>
 	<li>For well-browned exterior bark, return to egg for 15 minutes and open vents, allowing temperature to rise to 300°F or higher.</li>
 	<li>Allow brisket to rest for 15 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.</li>
 	<li>To hold until dinner time, wrap in foil and store in a cooler, topped with towels.  This will limit heat loss to about 10-15°F per hour.</li>
</ol>
