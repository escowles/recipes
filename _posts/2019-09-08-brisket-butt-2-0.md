Brisket, approx. 4-5 lbs.  
Lump charcoal
* Marinate brisket/butt overnight, see [brisket marinade]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-08-22-brisket-marinade %}), [mojo marinade]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-05-05-mojo-chicken %}), or just rubbed with salt. Rinse off salt and coat with [Kansas City rub]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-04-kansas-city-rub %}).
* Fill egg with charcoal, light with firestarter, close lid with chimney uncovered to promote chimney effect, and wait until fire is well started, about 10 minutes.
* Cover chimney with adjustable vent lid, and close down bottom and top airflow to regulate temperature, adjusting to about 250°F.  For most stable temperature, make a change and wait a few minutes to see the full effect.
* Add the following to the smoker quickly to minimize oxygen allowed into the egg:  
  * plate spreader (feet up)
  * drip pan filled with 1L water
  * grill rack
  * brisket, fat side down
  * meat thermometer
* Smoke for a total of approximately 75 minutes per pound, opening lid as infrequently as possible.
* When brisket/butt is around 170°F and the temperature has plateaued, remove and wrap in foil with ½ cup of liquid (beer, wine, broth, apple juice, etc.).
* Continue smoking until temperature reaches 200°F.
* Remove foil, reserving drippings for gravy if desired.
* For well-browned exterior bark, return to egg for 15 minutes and open vents, allowing temperature to rise to 300°F or higher.
* Allow brisket to rest for 15 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.
* To hold until dinner time, wrap in foil and store in a cooler, topped with towels.  This will limit heat loss to about 10-15°F per hour.

2020-10-04 11:40:06: Timeline:
* 6:00 wake up, read news, cup of tea
* 6:30 rinse, slather, and rub butt
* 6:40 egg setup
* 7:00 fire lit, mise en place
* 7:15 butt on fire

ETA: 4.25 lbs. * 75 min = 5hrs 20min -> 12:30  
but the guideline in the recipe has never been true, so really:
* it'll stall around 11, wrap at 3, up to 200F at 5, and ready to eat around 6
