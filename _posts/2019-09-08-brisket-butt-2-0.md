<ul>
 	<li>Brisket, approx. 4-5 lbs.</li>
 	<li>Lump charcoal</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>Marinate brisket/butt overnight, see <a href="https://escowles.github.io/recipes/ingredients/2015/08/22/brisket-marinade.html">brisket marinade</a>, <a href="https://escowles.github.io/recipes/main/2013/05/05/mojo-chicken.html">mojo marinade</a>, or just rubbed with salt. Rinse off salt and coat with <a href="https://escowles.github.io/recipes/ingredients/2017/09/04/kansas-city-rub.html">Kansas City rub</a>.</li>
 	<li>Fill egg with charcoal, light with firestarter, close lid with chimney uncovered to promote chimney effect, and wait until fire is well started, about 10 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Cover chimney with adjustable vent lid, and close down bottom and top airflow to regulate temperature, adjusting to about 250°F.  For most stable temperature, make a change and wait a few minutes to see the full effect.</li>
 	<li>Add the following to the smoker quickly to minimize oxygen allowed into the egg:  
<ol>
 	<li>plate spreader (feet up)</li>
 	<li>drip pan filled with 1L water</li>
 	<li>grill rack</li>
 	<li>brisket, fat side down</li>
 	<li>meat thermometer</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Smoke for a total of approximately 75 minutes per pound, opening lid as infrequently as possible.</li>
 	<li>When brisket/butt is around 170°F and the temperature has plateaued, remove and wrap in foil with ½ cup of liquid (beer, wine, broth, apple juice, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Continue smoking until temperature reaches 200°F.</li>
 	<li>Remove foil, reserving drippings for gravy if desired.</li>
 	<li>For well-browned exterior bark, return to egg for 15 minutes and open vents, allowing temperature to rise to 300°F or higher.</li>
 	<li>Allow brisket to rest for 15 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.</li>
 	<li>To hold until dinner time, wrap in foil and store in a cooler, topped with towels.  This will limit heat loss to about 10-15°F per hour.</li>
</ol>

2020-10-04 11:40:06: Timeline:
* 6:00 wake up, read news, cup of tea
* 6:30 rinse, slather, and rub butt
* 6:40 egg setup
* 7:00 fire lit, mise en place
* 7:15 butt on fire

ETA: 4.25 lbs. * 75 min = 5hrs 20min -> 12:30  
but the guideline in the recipe has never been true, so really:
* it'll stall around 11, wrap at 3, up to 200F at 5, and ready to eat around 6
