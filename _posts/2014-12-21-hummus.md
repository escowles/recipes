8/12/25: updating recipe with Rainbow Plant Life's instructions, which are basically
the same as what i had before, except she wants the chickpeas cooked and has a different
topping.

8/27/25: made this a few weeks ago and it was fantastic â€” cooking the chickpeas really
does make a huge difference in the texture. i updated the instructions to saute the
garlic, because the raw garlic was a little sharper than i would like.
