2017-07-29 23:48:04: Good variant:
* Asiago cheese
* 3 slices British bacon
* Broccoli
* Don't bother blind baking the crust

2020-06-20 20:33:01: Updated 6/20 to reflect typical modifications: adding broccoli,
tomatoes, etc., reducing egg mixture so it's not too much for the shallow pie dish I
usually use. Also, Gruyere is traditional, and my mom used to call this "Quiche
Laverne" when using Cheddar instead.

2022-06-27: Crustless mini quiche variant:
* Line muffin tin with paper liners
* Divide the ingredients evenly between the twelve muffin wells
* Bake at 375째F for 15-20 minutes, until a knife comes out clean
