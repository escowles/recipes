3/10/2024: updating to use rice mix instead of plain rice, because i've been 
generally unhappy with how bland chicken & rice recipes have turned out.

3/10/2024 bis: turned out well, but a little spicy (the salsa was very hot) and
some burning and underdone rice. adjusted the timing and directions for this, but
overall it was very good.
