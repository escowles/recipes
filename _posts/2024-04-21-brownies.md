04/21/2024: the original recipe made enough for a 9x13" pan, which is more brownies
than i want, esp. while i'm trying out a new recipe. so i halved this for an 8x8"
pan.

05/09/2024: finally got around to making this (added gram measurements because the volume measures
are all fiddly), and the results were very good. i did not include chocolate chips (which would
probably make this even better) and used hershey's cocoa instead of dutch. and my gram measurements
differ substantially from the original recipe.

anyway, these produced exactly the kind of brownies i like: moist and rich, not too fudgey and gooey
and not too dry and cakey.
