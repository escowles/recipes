option (hard to work with dough, resulting in overthick crust, and the flavor's not
great, either).  Would rather have an Oreo crust (see [Oreo Mini Cheesecakes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-16-oreo-mini-cheesecakes %})).

Also, we could do a traditional custard (like in [Berry Trifle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 1969-12-31-berry-trifle %})).
