Chocolate Pie Crust
  
1¼ cup flour  
¼ tsp. salt  
¼ tsp. baking powder  
2 Tbsp. cocoa powder  
1 Tbsp. sugar  
8 Tbsp. cold butter, cubed  
4-5 Tbsp. cold water  
 * Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
 * Add dry ingredients to food processor, and pulse to combine.
 * Add butter and pulse until the texture is a coarse meal.
 * Slowly add water, pulsing after each addition, until the dough clumps together and forms a ball.
 * Roll crust out on a floured surface, to fit a 9" pie pan.
 * Press crust into pan, trim edges, and poke holes in the bottom of the crust with a fork.
 * Bake for at 425°F for 10 minutes, then cool to room temperature.

Chocolate Cream Filling
  
1 cup heavy cream (divided)  
5 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, chopped  
 * Heat half the cream to just boiling, then pour over chocolate in a heat-safe bowl.
 * Let sit 2 minutes, then stir until melted and mixture is smooth, then rest 10 minutes.
 * Beat remaining cream until soft peaks form, then fold into chocolate cream.
 * Pour into pie crust, then chill.

Custard Filling
  
5 Tbsp. sugar  
1½ Tbsp. cornstarch  
¼ tsp. salt  
3 egg yolks  
1¼ cup half and half  
1 Tbsp. butter  
1 tsp. vanilla  
 * Combine sugar, cornstarch, salt, egg yolks, and half and half in a saucepan. Stir and heat over medium heat until thickened and bubbling.
 * Remove from heat, add remaining ingredients, and stir to combine.
 * Chill for 30 minutes.

2019-07-18 11:17:54: Like this pie a lot, but don't think the crust is the best
option (hard to work with dough, resulting in overthick crust, and the flavor's not
great, either).  Would rather have an Oreo crust (see [Oreo Mini Cheesecakes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-16-oreo-mini-cheesecakes %})).

Also, we could do a traditional custard (like in [Berry Trifle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 1969-12-31-berry-trifle %})).

2021-07-16: Used the [oreo crust]({{ site.base_url}}{% post_url 2021-07-12-oreo-pie-crust %}), and
chilled with just the chocolate, bananas, and custard filling. Topped each piece with whipped cream
and dusted with oreo crumbs. This is definitely better than the chocolate crust and topping the
whole pie before cutting.
