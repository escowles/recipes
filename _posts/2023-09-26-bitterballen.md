**braised beef:**

1 Tbsp. olive oil  
1 - 1.5 lbs. chuck roast, cut into 1-2" cubes  
* heat oil in a dutch oven and sear beef until browned
* remove and cover to keep warm

1 Tbsp. olive oil  
1 onion, quartered  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
1 cup baby carrots, chopped  
salt and pepper, to taste  
1 qt. chicken stock  
* saute onion, garlic, and carrots in oil until browned
* return beef to the pot and season with salt and pepper to taste
* add chicken stock and heat to a low simmer
* cover and transfer to a 350°F oven for 2 hours
* let cool, then separate and shred beef and reserve liquid

**bitterballen mix:**

2 tbsp. butter  
2 tbsp. flour  
1 tsp. allspice  
1 tsp. worcestershire sauce  
salt and pepper, to taste
* melt butter in a saucepan, then stir in flour and whisk to work out any lumps
* cook over low heat until the roux turns blonde, about 3 minutes
* add 250ml (1 cup plus 1 tbsp.) of the reserved braising liquid and whisk to make
  a smooth sauce
* add shredded beef, allspice, and optional worcestershire sauce and cook until
  thickened, about 2 minutes
* taste and adjust seasoning
* spread on a baking sheet to cool to room temperature, then cover and chill for at
  least 2 hours

**meatballs:**

1 cup flour  
2 eggs, beaten  
1 cup bread crumbs  
* scoop a 1 oz. ball of filling and roll to smooth out
* dredge in flour, then egg and breadcrumbs
* fry at 350°F for 5-6 minutes until well browned, or bake at 350°F for 15 minutes,
  until internal temperature reaches 165°F

**buns:**

* instead of chilling and making meatballs, make a batch of dough for [pull-apart
  yeast rolls]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-09-14-pull-apart-yeast-rolls %})
* flatten each dough ball out into a taco-sized disc, fill with 1/4 cup of beef
  filling, then fold and pinch under to seal
* bake as normal (though the buns will be larger than the rolls, so 9 will fit in a
  9x9" pan instead of 16

9/29/23: finally made these last night and they were good — but the breading and baking was a lot
of hassle, and the final output wasn't really worth the effort. but i think the braised beef is a
keeper. so next time i'll braise the beef, separate the liquid, make the roux, and then just return
the beef and vegetables to the pot and thicken the sauce. then serve it over rice or potatoes.

6/16/26: made bitterbuns instead of bitterballs tonight, and they were fantastic.
added the directions above.
