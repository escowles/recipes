9/29/23: finally made these last night and they were good — but the breading and baking was a lot
of hassle, and the final output wasn't really worth the effort. but i think the braised beef is a
keeper. so next time i'll braise the beef, separate the liquid, make the roux, and then just return
the beef and vegetables to the pot and thicken the sauce. then serve it over rice or potatoes.
