2018-11-21 00:05:09: first try:
* 6 Tbsp. butter
* 6 Tbsp. flour
* 2 Tbsp. curry powder
* 1 Tbsp. garam masala
* 1/2 tsp. cayenne powder

conclusion: promising, but flawed (way too hot, too spicy, missing umami)

next time:

* 6 Tbsp. butter
* 6 Tbsp. flour
* 2 Tbsp. curry powder
* 1 tsp. garam masala
* 1/8 tsp. cayenne
use chicken stock instead of water for the curry, and add 1 Tbsp. of sesame oil at the end

2020-03-31 22:41:55: made recipe as directed except 1/2 tsp chipotle pepper instead
of cayenne & added 1 tbsp soy sauce â€” very good, but too hot and would be better with
less garam masala.

so, for next time: 
* 6 Tbsp. butter
* 6 Tbsp. flour
* 1 Tbsp. curry powder
* 1 Tbsp. soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp. garam masala
* 1/4 tsp. chipotle powder
use chicken stock instead of water for the curry, and add 1 Tbsp. of sesame oil at the end
