Brisket, approx. 4 lbs.  
Lump charcoal  
2 cups barbecue sauce, e.g., [Big Al's KC Barbecue sauce]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-07-22-big-als-kc-barbecue-sauce %}) (optional)  
Wood chips (mesquite, etc.) (optional)  

* Marinate brisket/butt overnight, see brisket marinade or [mojo mariande]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-05-05-mojo-chicken %})
* Coat brisket/butt in barbecue sauce and set aside. (optional)
* Soak wood chips in water and set aside. (optional)
* Fill smoker firebox with lump charcoal, light and wait until fire is well started, about 10 minutes.
* Close the smoker lid and carefully monitor as it heats up.  Close vents to regulate temperature as it approaches 225°F and stabilize the temperature at 250°F.
* Add the following to the smoker quickly to minimize oxygen allowed into the smoker:  
  * chips directly on charcoal (optional)
  * plate spreader (feet up)
  * drip pan filled with water
  * grill rack
  * brisket, fat side down

* Smoke for a total of 1 hour 15 minutes per pound, opening lid as infrequently as possible.
* With 2 hours left and brisket/butt is between 150°F and 170°F, remove and wrap in foil with ½ cup of liquid (beer, wine, broth, apple juice, etc.).
* * Continue smoking for last 2 hours until temperature is 200°F.
* Remove foil, reserving drippings for gravy if desired.
* For well-browned exterior bark, return to smoker for 15 minutes and open vents, allowing temperature to rise to 300°F or higher.
* Allow brisket to rest for 15 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.
