10/14/25: made this last night with cubed butternut squash, and it was good but some of
the squash was still more firm that i would like. and two heads of garlic was a lot for
not contributing much to the dish. so i upped the time for the squash and switched to
slicing a smaller amount of garlic layered under the chicken so it doesn't burn.
