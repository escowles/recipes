2020-09-23 18:36:46: Note: 1.33 cups of water is not quite enough, the dough was too
dry and not cohesive. Added water and then a bit of flour until the dough texture was
right — should probably be 1.5 or 1.75 cups water, or maybe reduce initial flour and
add rest once the dough is wet?

2020-09-30 Actually, a little more kneading is probably all this needs to work the
water into the flour and avoid making the dough too wet (though that's pretty
annoying given the title of this recipe).
