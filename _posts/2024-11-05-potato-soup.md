11/06/2024: made this last night and it was ok, but even halved the recipe was a lot. i got the
roux ratio slightly off, which wound up making the soup thicker than planned. i also pureed the
whole thing (because dental issues prevent me from chewing) which probably didn't help the texture.
lastly, i used my homemade bacon, which provided good flavor, but less fat than expecting because
it's already been smoked. this led to a patina that deglazed and made the color too beige. next time
i will either clean the patina off or cook the bacon in a separate pan.
