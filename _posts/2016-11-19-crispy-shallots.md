1 cup oil  
3 shallots, sliced lengthwise  

  * Put oil and shallots in saucepan and heat slowly for about 15 minutes, until they gradually become brown.
  * Turn down heat if they are coloring too quickly.
  * Drain in a sieve over a bowl, then dry with paper towels.
  * Will become crisp as they cool, and can be made in advance.
