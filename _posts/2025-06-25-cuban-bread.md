**dough:**

1 1/4 cups water  
2 1/4 tsp. yeast  
2 tsp. sugar  
* mix together in a small bowl and set aside to let yeast activate

55g lard, melted  
2 tsp. salt  
470g bread flour  
* add lard, salt, and half the flour to the yeast mixture and mix into a paste
* add remaining flour until a sticky dough forms
* knead dough for 10-15 minutes, until it passes the windowpane test (can be
  stretched thin enough that it is translucent in places)
* cover dough and let rise until doubled, 60-90 minutes

**shaping:**
* turn dough out on a floured surface, punch down, and divide into two pieces
* roll each piece of dough into a rectangle, then roll into a long roll
* pinch ends to seal and roll out to about 18"
* top each loaf with two lengths of string (or traditionally palmetto fronds) and
  turn over so the string/fronds are on the bottom
* cover with plastic wrap and prove until almost doubled, about 45-60 minutes

**baking:**
* turn loaves over onto parchment-lined baking sheets
* preheat oven and add a metal baking dish to the lower rack
* add a cup of water into the metal baking dish, then quickly close the door
* bake at 425°F for 25-30 minutes (removing the water for the last 5 minutes), until
  the loaves are golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200°F.
* cool the loaves on a wire rack for 45-60 minutes before slicing
