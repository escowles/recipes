1 cup unsalted butter, softened  
3½ cups powdered sugar  
½ cup cocoa powder  
½ tsp. salt  
2 tsp. vanilla extract  
3 Tbsp. cream or milk  

* Using a stand mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth and creamy (about 2 minutes).
* Reduce speed to low and slowly add 3 cups of confectioners' sugar, the cocoa powder, and salt. Beat until sugar/cocoa are absorbed into the butter, about 2 minutes.
* Turn mixer to medium speed and add the vanilla and milk/cream. Once added, turn the mixer to high speed and beat for 1 minute.
* Add the last 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar if you'd like to increase the frosting's thickness.
* Pipe or spread the frosting onto cooled cupcakes.
