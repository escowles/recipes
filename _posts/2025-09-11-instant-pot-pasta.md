8 oz. pasta  
2 cups water  
* add to instant pot and pressure cook on high
* to find the cook time, divide the lowest boil time by 2 and then subtract 2 (for 4-5
  minute boil times, this will be 0, which is a real setting that gets up to pressure
  and then immediately starts a natural release)
* natural release for 5 minutes, then vent remaining pressure
