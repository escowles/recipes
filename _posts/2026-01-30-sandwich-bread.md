3 cups (360g) all-purpose flour

1/2 cup milk  
4 tbsp. melted butter  
2 tbsp. sugar  
1 1/4 tsp. (8g) table salt  
2 tsp. instant yeast  
* weigh flour or measure by gently spooning into a measuring cup and leveling off any
  excess
* tangzhong technique (optional): take 3 tbsp. of flour and 1/2 cup water from above
  and cook on medium heat until thickened, whisking constantly (about 1 1/2 - 2 1/2
  minutes)
* add all ingredients (including tangzhong if using) to stand mixer bowl and knead
  on medium-low for 5-7 minutes, adding 1 tbsp. flour at a time until the dough just
  cleans the sides of the bowl (sticking at bottom is ok)
* remove to a lightly greased bowl, cover, and rise for 1-2 hours
* punch down, shape into an 8" log and place in a greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan
  and lightly cover with greased plastic wrap
* rise for 60 minutes, until the dough rises about 1" over the top of the pan
* bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes, until lightly browned and internal temperature
  reaches 190°F
* remove from pan and cool to room temperature on a wire rack before slicing
