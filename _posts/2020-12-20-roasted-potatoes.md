2 lb. roasting potatoes (pref. russet, but yukon or red will do)  
4 Tbsp. fat (can be olive or canola oil, or melted bacon grease, duck fat, etc.,
  basically anything but butter)  
seasoning to taste  
* cube potatoes and cover with cold water in a large pot
* bring to a full boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes
* while the potatoes are boiling, heat oven to 400Â°F, grease a roasting pan with
  2 Tbsp. fat, and preheat it in the oven
* drain potatoes well, then return to the pot over low heat to drive off moisture
  and rough up surfaces by stirring or shaking
* toss with remaining fat and season with salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic, etc.
* add potatoes carefully to hot roasting pan, and bake until golden and crispy,
  about 30 minutes
* turn potatoes every 10 minutes to cook evenly and prevent burning
