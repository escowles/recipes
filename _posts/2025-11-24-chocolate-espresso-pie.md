12/07/2025: made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. i used an oreo crust,
which did not hold together very well, so i would make it individual parfaits next
time. also, the two puddings made more than would fit in a standard 9" pie, so i
wound up using all of the chocolate and half the coffee pudding. so i would keep the
same ratio and halve the coffee pudding recipe.
