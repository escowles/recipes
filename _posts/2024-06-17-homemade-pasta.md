2 cups (225g) flour  
1/2 tsp. salt  
3 eggs  
1 1/2 tsp. olive oil  
* mix flour and salt in a mixing bowl
* add eggs and oil and stir into flour mixture to make a shaggy dough
* turn out onto a floured board and knead 8-10 minutes
* shape dough into a ball, cover, and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes
* quarter the dough and process each piece:
  * flatten into an oval and process with a pasta maker three times on widest setting (#1)
  * process 2-3 times on progressively thinner settings (#2 - #6)
  * dust with flour to keep the sheet of pasta from being too wet to prevent sticking,
  * fold into a book fold and re-process to square up any tears, clumps, or irregularities
  * rest on a floured board or cookie sheet while processing remaining pieces
  * process with pasta cutter to make noodles
  * cover with a damp towel until ready to cook
* cook in salted boiling water until desired doneness, 1-2 minutes

06/17/2024: made fettuccine alfredo and it was an adventure:
* the second and third eggs slid out of the nest so i started mixing by hand which made
  a sticky mess i had to scrape off my fingers
* i didn't dust enough with flour, and the dough stuck to the pasta machine several times
* the noodles from the too-wet pasta stuck together and made a lump
* some of the pasta was a little too chewy

all that said, it was still very tasty, so i've updated the recipe to avoid those problems
and hope to try again soon.
