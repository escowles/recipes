12/23/24 brewday notes:
* this batch was trouble right away, when i realized i didn't have a mash tun
  that was the right size. so i went with 3 gallons of mash water (instead of
  1.25 per the recipe), and hoped that a slow extraction and/or boiling down
  would make up for it (accepting i'd probably not get anywhere near the target
  gravity).
* this was also my first batch trying to scale down for the pinter, so i wasn't
  quite sure exactly what i was doing.
* and i couldn't even print my checklist because my laptop didn't recognize my
  printer (it thought it was only a scanner). i eventually was able to print it from
  my phone after much swearing.
* the wort was way worse than i expected, with readings between 1.004 and 1.008, so
  i put a lid on the collecting pot and went to whole earth market because i
  rememebered seeing malt syrup there. they did have it, but it was $10 for a 20 oz.
  jar. so i got two and added them, which brought the gravity up to a decent level
  (1.048).
* boil went well, though it set off the smoke alarm several times â€” still not
  sure what that was about. got a lot of boil off because it's so dry (one of
  the reasons i brewed today was that it was 10% RH in our kitchen this
  morning).
* chilling and filtering was a mess because the filter kept getting clogged.
  but we eventually got it filtered and chilled to room temp, and pitched the
  yeast in the pinter.
* as i was cleaning up, i noticed the grain wasn't soggy, and upon closer 
  inspection, it clearly wasn't milled. so it was just a really expensive tea.
