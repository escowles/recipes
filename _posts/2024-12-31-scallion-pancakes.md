01/02/2025: i made these a couple of nights ago and they were tasty, served with
chili crisp and leftover brisket. but they tough, i think because they were thicker
than they were supposed to be, because of the thickness of the scallions. next time
i'll try chopping them in the food processor to make sure they are thin enough.
