1 cup flour  
½ cup lukewarm filtered water  
1 tsp. dry yeast  
* Mix all ingredients in a 1-quart mason jar (flour and water should be equal by weight), adding water if needed to make a thick paste.
* Cover with a wet towel, and rest for 24 hours at room temperature.
* Feed the starter, and continue feeding weekly.
* Refrigerate when not feeding and using.

Feeding and Using

* Discard all but ½ cup of the starter. It will contain less-active yeast, and can be used to make baked good that do not need to rise.
* Add 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup lukewarm filtered water.
* Mix thoroughly and let rest 4-10 hours at room temperature, until risen and starting to fall.
* Use a chunk of starter to make [sourdough bread]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-19-sourdough-bread %}).
