9 blood oranges (Moro)  
6 cups water  
5 cups sugar  

  * Wash oranges, then cut off top and bottom tips
  * Quarter oranges lengthwise, then remove core and seeds from each quarter, reserving for later
  * Thinly slice each quarter crosswise (optionally slice each arc in half for short grain)
  * Bundle up reserved cores in cheesecloth and tie tightly
  * Put slices in a large bowl along with the bundle of cores, cover with water, and refrigerate overnight
  * Discard cores, pour slices and water into a large pot
  * Add sugar and stir until combined
  * Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered until reduced by half and thickened
  * Marmalade is done when the juices are reduced enough that they don't form a layer on top of the fruit, or when you put a tablespoon on a plate and refrigerate for 10 minutes, and the consistency is as thick as desired
  * Transfer to jars sterilized with boiling water, and let cool before refrigerating.
