9 blood oranges (Moro)  
6 cups water  
5 cups sugar  
<ul>
 	<li>Wash oranges, then cut off top and bottom tips</li>
 	<li>Quarter oranges lengthwise, then remove core and seeds from each quarter, reserving for later</li>
 	<li>Thinly slice each quarter crosswise (optionally slice each arc in half for short grain)</li>
 	<li>Bundle up reserved cores in cheesecloth and tie tightly</li>
 	<li>Put slices in a large bowl along with the bundle of cores, cover with water, and refrigerate overnight</li>
 	<li>Discard cores, pour slices and water into a large pot</li>
 	<li>Add sugar and stir until combined</li>
 	<li>Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered until reduced by half and thickened</li>
 	<li>Marmalade is done when the juices are reduced enough that they don't form a layer on top of the fruit, or when you put a tablespoon on a plate and refrigerate for 10 minutes, and the consistency is as thick as desired</li>
 	<li>Transfer to jars sterilized with boiling water, and let cool before refrigerating.</li>
</ul>
