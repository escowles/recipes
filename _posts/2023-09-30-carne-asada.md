10/4/23: made this last weekend and it was fantastic. made a few small changes (reduced salt,
using dry cilantro, either skirt or flank steak) to reflect what i actually wound up doing.

10/8/23: made again with two changes: 1 tbsp. of salt and flank steak. it was good, but not
quite as good. in particular, the flank steak was one large slab, so it was uneven (160°F in
the middle but only 135°F at the edges). so next time i'll make two tweaks: use 1.5 tbsp. of
salt, and if using flank steak, i'd cut it in half so i could rotate to cook more evenly.

3/24/25: made this recipe with flank steak, and it was pretty tough. some ideas for improvement:
* i accidentally used orange drink instead of real oj, so that would probably help
* longer marinating time (i did 4 hours, but could do overnight)
* cutting the flank steak in half
* cooking to 130°F instead of 140°F, and resting for 10 minutes (i've seen comments online that
  flank steak gets tough around 140°F, and there was a lot of juices released which is a sign of
  being overcooked)
