cheese mixture: original recipe calls for 1/2 cup of Parmesan and Jack, 1 cup of cheddar and muenster, and 1 cup of Velveeta

no-bake version: after adding the macaroni, return to heat and cook until cheese is thoroughly melted, about 10 minutes.

9/23/2024: deprecating this recipe — i never made it and see that i made several adjustments because
i don't want to use muenster and velveeta, so why bother?
