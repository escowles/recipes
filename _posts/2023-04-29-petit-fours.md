## cake:

1/3 cup butter  
2 oz. cream cheese  
3/4 cup sugar  
2 eggs  
1 tsp. vanilla  
2 Tbsp. milk  
* let butter, cream cheese, and eggs come to room temperature
* cream butter, cream cheese, and sugar in stand mixer
* add eggs one at a time and mix until incorporated
* add vanilla and milk and mix

1 cup flour  
1/4 tsp. salt  
1/2 tsp. baking powder  
* mix flour, salt, and baking powder in a small bowl
* add to wet ingredients and mix
* pour batter into two 8" square pans lined with baking parchment
* bake at 350°F for 13-15 minutes (cake will be pale)
* let cool completely, then cut into 1 1/2" squares
* cut squares crosswise into thin layers, and fill with any filling or frosting,
  making cubes by stacking 2-3 layers
* cover with plastic wrap and freeze while making icing

alternate baking:
* to make one 9" round cake layer (about 1" thick), bake at 350°F for 20-25 minutes.
* to make three thin 9" round cake layers, make a double batch and divide between three cake pans,
  bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes.

## icing:

7 1/2 Tbsp. butter  
3/4 tbsp. cream  
1/8 tsp. salt  
3/4 tsp. vanilla  
2 1/4 cups powdered sugar  
3 Tbsp. corn syrup or simple syrup  
food coloring if desired  
* heat butter and cream in a double boiler until melted
* remove from the heat and stir in salt and vanilla
* slowly mix in powdered sugar until smooth
* add corn/sugar syrup and any food coloring and mix in
* add cream or powdered sugar as needed to adjust consistency (it should hold its
  shape for a second when drizzled into the bowl)
* spoon icing over petit fours and transfer to a drying rack
* let dry completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator before serving

5/14/23: icing didn't work very well, but the cake is good (though the instructions
say to cut into 1.5" cubes, but that's much larger than normal petit fours.
