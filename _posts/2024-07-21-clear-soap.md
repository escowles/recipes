8/4/24: made this a couple weeks ago and when i added the everclear, it didn't really
blend, it just separated back out into liquid and lumps of soap. i even added a
second dose of everclear (the rest of the bottle) and got the same effect. but when
i added the simple syrup, it came together. next time i might try just using the
simple syrup, but definitely wouldn't add the whole bottle of everclear.
