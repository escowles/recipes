4/29/23: first time making these, and they were very good — the first time i've
made doughnuts at home that were worth the bother. some notes for next time:
* i used a small ice cream/cookie scoop and the doughnuts wound up being a little
  larger than i would like (and some of them were misshapen because they dangled
  from the scoop). so next time i will use a spoon to make slightly smaller
  doughnuts and scrape them off to prevent stretching. 
* i thought the glaze was a tiny bit too thin, but Wind liked it as-is. i tried
  double-glazing a few, but the glaze didn't set as well.
