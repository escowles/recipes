500g (3 2/3 cups) flour  
75g (6 Tbsp.) sugar  
1 tsp. salt  
1 tsp. cinnamon  
1/2 tsp. nutmeg  
7g (2 tsp.) dry yeast  
2 large eggs  

* heat milk and butter until melted
* add dry ingredients to stand mixer bowl and pour in milk mixture
* add eggs while mixing, and mix 7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic
* cover and let rise until the dough has doubled, about 1 hour

**filling:**

55g (1/4 cup) butter, softened  
150g (2/3 cup) brown sugar  
4 tsp. cinnamon

* roll into a tight roll and slice into nine 2" or twelve 1.5" rolls

* optional: refrigerate overnight before rising, and warm up in a 130°F oven in the morning
* bake at 350°F for 22-25 minutes, until lightly golden, then cool in pan for 15 minutes

filling variants:
* use nutella instead of the cinnamon filling
* peel, thinly slice, and chop two granny smith apples, and saute them in half of the butter for
  10 minutes. butter the dough with the remaining butter, top with brown sugar, and then spread
  the apple pieces on top before rolling

1 Tbsp. simple syrup or milk  
1/2 tsp. vanilla  
1/4 tsp. salt
