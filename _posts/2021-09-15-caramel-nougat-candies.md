**nougat:**

1 cup lightly-salted cocktail peanuts  
3/4 cup sugar  
1/4 cup medium-intensity honey (e.g., wildflower)  
2 Tbsp. water  
1 egg white  
1/4 tsp. salt  
* remove skins from peanuts and split halves apart
* combine sugar, honey, and water in a small pan and heat over medium heat until sugar dissolves
* heat until temperature reaches 295°F
* beat egg white and salt in stand mixer until stiff peaks form (you may need to beat by hand to
  make a single egg white have enough volume that a stand mixer will work)
* slowly pour hot syrup into egg white while mixer is running
* continue mixing until meringue is very thick and cooled, about 5 minutes
* fold in peanuts
* line 8" x 8" pan with baking parchment and brush with oil to prevent sticking
* spread nougat in pan and top with plastic wrap brushed with oil
* press nougat into corners of the pan and smooth out the top
* let cool at room temperature until firm, 2-3 hours


**caramel:**

250g sugar  
85ml cream  
90g butter  
1 tsp. vanilla  
1/2 tsp. salt  
* heat sugar over medium heat, stirring occasionally until it melts and darkens, and reaches 347°F
* heat cream until steaming then remove sugar from heat and pour in cream (it will steam a lot)
* stir until combined, then stir occasionally and bring to 250°F
* remove from heat and add butter and mix until combined
* add vanilla and salt then pour over nougat
* let cool at room temperature until firm, 2-3 hours


**assembly:**

8 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips  
8 oz. milk chocolate chips
* chill caramel/nougat and cut into 1" squares with sharp knife (brush with oil and wash frequently
  to reduce sticking)
* melt 12 oz. of chocolate chips in double boiler or in 30 second bursts in microwave (stirring
  between each burst)
* add remaining chocolate chips and stir until smooth and glossy
* use two forks to pick up caramel/nougat squares, dip and coat in chocolate, then let cool on
  a parchment-lined baking sheet
* chill for 10 minutes to set chocolate, but serve at room temperature
