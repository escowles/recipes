4-6 strips bacon (not thick-cut)  
* arrange in single layer on a rack over a baking tray
* bake at 400Â°F for 15 minutes, or until desired crispiness

3/10/2024: i've tried a bunch of slight variations on this, including several
different temperatures, rack vs. not, and oven vs. toaster oven. this recipe
is what i did today and got the best results, though i think going a minute or
two longer would get even crispier bacon without burning.
