1850 Cal (12x 154)

4 cups flour  
2 cups lukewarm water  
1 pkg yeast  
2 tsp salt  
pinch sugar  

* Soften yeast in 1 cup of water with the sugar for 15 minutes, until bubbly.
* While mixing, add flour, salt and then the rest of the water, until you have a sticky dough.  Knead for 15 minutes and place in oiled or floured bowl, covered with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, until doubled (2-4 hours). 
* Turn out onto baking parchment or floured baking sheet, punch down, and let rise for 30 minutes.  Roll out and fold several times and place on floured baking sheet.  Let rise 1-2 hours.  Before it has doubled, brush with butter (or egg whites for extra crispy bread) and make diagonal slits with a knife.
* Place some water in a dish in the bottom of the oven to make it humid, and bake for 15 minutes at 465F, then 390F for an additional 15 minutes.  Remove to rack to cool.
