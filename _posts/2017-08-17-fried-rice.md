The great thing about fried rice is you can use up whatever leftovers you have around, so take this as a general guideline:  
  
2 Tbsp. peanut or canola oil  
Â½ onion, diced  
1 bell pepper, diced  
2 cloves garlic, minced  

  * Heat oil in wok and stir fry vegetables until softened
  * Other vegetables can be added, such as broccoli, baby corn, water chestnuts

1 lb. chicken, cubed (or whatever leftover meat)  

  * Add to vegetables and stir fry until browned, 3-5 minutes

2-3 cups rice, cooked  
3 Tbsp. soy sauce, or to taste  
salt and pepper, to taste  
2 eggs  
1 Tbsp. sesame oil  

  * Add rice to wok and stir fry until warmed, breaking up any lumps in cold rice
  * Season with soy sauce, salt and pepper
  * Make a well in the wok and scramble the eggs, then mix into the rice when cooked
  * Mix in sesame oil then immediately remove from heat
