The great thing about fried rice is you can use up whatever leftovers you have around, so take this as a general guideline:  
  
2 Tbsp. peanut or canola oil  
Â½ onion, diced  
1 bell pepper, diced  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
<ul>
 	<li>Heat oil in wok and stir fry vegetables until softened</li>
 	<li>Other vegetables can be added, such as broccoli, baby corn, water chestnuts</li>
</ul>
1 lb. chicken, cubed (or whatever leftover meat)  
<ul>
 	<li>Add to vegetables and stir fry until browned, 3-5 minutes</li>
</ul>
2-3 cups rice, cooked  
3 Tbsp. soy sauce, or to taste  
salt and pepper, to taste  
2 eggs  
1 Tbsp. sesame oil  
<ul>
 	<li>Add rice to wok and stir fry until warmed, breaking up any lumps in cold rice</li>
 	<li>Season with soy sauce, salt and pepper</li>
 	<li>Make a well in the wok and scramble the eggs, then mix into the rice when cooked</li>
 	<li>Mix in sesame oil then immediately remove from heat</li>
</ul>
