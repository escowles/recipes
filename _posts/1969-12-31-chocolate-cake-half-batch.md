### Cake:

7/8 cup flour, plus more for pans  
1 cup sugar  
3/8 cups cocoa powder (6 Tbsp.)  
1 tsp. baking soda  
1/2 tsp. baking powder  
1/2 tsp. kosher salt  
1/2 cup buttermilk, shaken  
1/4 cup vegetable oil  
1 extra-large egg, at room temperature  
1/2 tsp. vanilla  
1/2 cup freshly brewed hot coffee  

* Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  Mix on low speed until combined.
* Combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla.  Slowly add to dry ingredients while mixing.  Add coffee and mix until just combined.
* Pour batter into 2 greased and floured 8" cake pans.
* Bake for at 350F for 35-40 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean (20-25 minutes for cupcakes).
* Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.
* Frost first layer, flat side up.  Top with second layer on top, rounded side up, and frost top and sides of the cake.

### Frosting:

3 oz. semisweet chocolate (1/2 cup chocolate chips)  
1/4 lb. unsalted butter, at room temperature (1 stick)  
1/2 extra-large egg yolk, at room temperature  
1/2 tsp. vanilla  
5/8 cups powdered sugar (1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp.)  

* Chop the chocolate and melt in double boiler.  Cool to room temperature.
* Mix butter on medium-high speed until light yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
* Add the egg yolk and vanilla and continue beating for 3 minutes.
* Turn the mixer to low, gradually add the confectioners' sugar, then beat at medium speed, scraping down the bowl as necessary, until smooth and creamy.
