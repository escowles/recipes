2 Tbsp. cinnamon

* put rolls in greased 9x12" pan and bake at 400°F for 17-20 minutes, until golden 
  brown on top.

**glaze:**

4 oz. cream cheese  
3 Tbsp. butter  
1/2 tsp. vanilla  
1/2 cup powdered sugar substitute

7/3/2022: on first try, these were not very good. there were a few problems that
were not necessarily the fault of the recipe though:
* the dough did not rise at all, maybe the yeast is off?
* i added 4 Tbsp. of butter instead of 3 to the glaze, and it wound up like whipped
  cream. should have adapted [cinnamon rolls glaze]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
    post_url 2021-05-16-cinnamon-rolls %}) instead.
* a little bit more salt might have improved the filling and glaze, too.
