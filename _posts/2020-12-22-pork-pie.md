4 slices bacon, chopped  
1 lb. ground pork  
* cook bacon until fat begins to render, about 2 minutes. add ground pork and brown,
  then remove from pan with a slotted spoon.

2 Tbsp. olive oil  
1 onion, coarsely chopped  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped  
salt and pepper  
* add to bacon and pork juices and saute until softened, about 8 minutes

2 small potatoes (red, yukon, etc.), cubed  
2 cups chicken stock  
1/8 tsp. cinnamon  
1/8 tsp. cloves  
* add to vegetables, along with meat, and simmer until broth is mostly evaporated,
  about 25-30 minutes.
* transfer to a bowl and let cool while making crust

1 egg  
1/2 cup fresh or 3 Tbsp. dry herbs (parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme)
* beat egg and stir into pork mixture with herbs

**12/22/2020 notes:**

* total prep and bake time: about 3 hours
* baked for full 60 minutes, but never bubbled up through vents, took it out
  because it was getting late
* did not quite fill up large oval casserole dish, but was able to roll bottom
  crust over top crust and it looked very nice
* used two very small yukon potatoes, and the filling was much more balanced than a
  traditional pork pie, but still meatier than a typical american pot pie — could
  add a third small potato, carrots, an apple, etc. to pad it out and add more
  vegetables to the dish
* i found the cinnamon and cloves nicely spicy and christmassy — but my son found
  it too much. so i'd dial back these spices next time (or any non-christmas-time)
* hot water crust definitely stands up on its own — if made in a spring form pan,
  this would stand up nicely and look great
* photo of leftover portion the next day (somewhat fallen):
