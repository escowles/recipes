Thanksgiving 2019:  
  
12 lb turkey  
3 Tbsp. kosher salt (¼ Tbsp. per pound)  
5 sprigs fresh thyme  
3 sprigs fresh sage  
2 sprigs fresh rosemary  
1 tsp. dry parsley  
1 large onion, diced  
1 small granny smith apple, diced  
½ cup butter, melted  
1 tsp. black pepper  
2 cups chicken stock  

* Thaw turkey for 6 hours per pound in the refrigerator, or 30 minutes per pound in a cold water bath (changed every 30 minutes).
* 24 hours before roasting, rinse turkey and pat dry. Rub all over with salt, including inside the cavities. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate, turning over every 8 hours.
* 2 hours before roasting, remove from refrigerator, pat dry (do not rinse). Place in roasting pan and rest uncovered at room temperature.
* 30 minutes before roasting, heat oven to 450°F, stuff both cavities with herbs, onion, and apple, brush with butter, and sprinkle with pepper.
* Bake for 30 minutes, then remove from oven and cover breast and wing tips with foil.
* Add stock to roasting pan and return to oven at 350°F for approximately 90-120 minutes. Check temperature of thigh with meat thermometer and remove when temperature reaches 165°F, tipping upright to empty juices from main cavity.
* Cover with foil, and then heavy towels and rest for 30-60 minutes while other dishes finish.

Turkey Gravy:

2 Tbsp. butter  
2 Tbsp. flour  
1 cup pan drippings  
1-2 cups chicken stock, as needed  

* Melt butter and mix in flour until all liquid is soaked up.
* Add drippings and break up lumps, then simmer until thickened.
* Add stock as needed to adjust thickness.
