<p><strong>Filling:</strong><br />¼ cup unsalted butter, softened<br />2/3 cup brown sugar<br />1½ Tbsp. cinnamon</p>
<ul>
<li>Add warm milk to mixer bowl and sprinkle yeast on top.</li>
<li>Wait until yeast bubbles, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add remaining ingredients, and mix with dough hook on medium speed 8-10 minutes, until dough forms a solid ball and is slightly sticky.</li>
<li>Remove dough to oiled bowl, cover, and let rise 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.</li>

<li>Roll dough tightly into a tube, ending with the unbuttered edge, and sealing dough.</li>
<li>Cut into 9 rolls, and add to 9x9" baking pan or 9" cake pan (lining pan with parchment will help the rolls release cleanly).</li>
