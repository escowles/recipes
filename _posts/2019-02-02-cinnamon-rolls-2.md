**Dough:**

¾ cup warm milk (110 degrees F)  
2¼ tsp. active yeast  
¼ cup sugar  
1 egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature  
¼ cup unsalted butter, melted  
3 cups bread flour  
¾ tsp. salt
* Add warm milk to mixer bowl and sprinkle yeast on top.
* Wait until yeast bubbles, about 5 minutes.
* Add remaining ingredients, and mix with dough hook on medium speed 8-10 minutes, until dough forms a solid ball and is slightly sticky.
* Remove dough to oiled bowl, cover, and let rise 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.
* Roll out dough into a 9x13" rectangle.

**Filling:**

¼ cup unsalted butter, softened  
2/3 cup brown sugar  
1½ Tbsp. cinnamon
* Spread butter over dough, leaving 1/4" of dough unbuttered on one short side.
* Mix brown sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle over butter, then rub in.
* Roll dough tightly into a tube, ending with the unbuttered edge, and sealing dough.
* Cut into 9 rolls, and add to 9x9" baking pan or 9" cake pan (lining pan with parchment will help the rolls release cleanly).
* Cover and let rise 30 minutes (or refrigerate overnight and let warm up to room temperature for 1 hour).
* Bake at 350°F for 20-25 minutes, until slightly golden brown.
* Let cool for 5 minutes before frosting.

**Cream Cheese Frosting:**

4 oz. cream cheese, softened  
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened  
¾ cup powdered sugar  
½ teaspoon vanilla
* Mix all ingredients until smooth and fluffy, then spread over cinnamon rolls.
