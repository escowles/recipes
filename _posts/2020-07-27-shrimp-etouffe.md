2020-08-06 20:08:52: Half-Shrimp/Half-Chicken batch (8/8):
* Saute 1 lb. cubed chicken in separate dish
* Make main dish as directed, except: before adding shrimp, take half of base and
  add to chicken, and add only 1 lb. of shrimp.
* Other substitutions: Used an extra poblano and 1 tsp. dried jalapeno flakes instead
  of the jalapeno, 4 oz. celery sticks instead of a stalk

Notes:
* Chicken too tough because not thawed and then cooked too hard
* Too spicy; reduce to 1/2 tsp. of jalapeno flakes at most
* Too much celery: reduce to 2 oz. of celery sticks
* Would like to have some tomato paste, add after ~1 tbsp. to shrimp batch after
  splitting
