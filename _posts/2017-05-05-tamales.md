1¼ lbs. pork loin roast  
1 onion, havled  
1 clove garlic  
 * Add all ingredients to Duch oven and cover with water.
 * Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer until meat is cooked through, about 2 hours.
 * Alternative: use [Cuban Roast Pork]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-23-cuban-roast-pork %}) or [Crockpot Carnitas]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-09-02-crockpot-carnitas %})
 * Shred the meat and mix with 1 cup of sauce (below).

4 dried California chiles  
2 cups water  
1½ tsp. salt  
 * Remove stems and seeds of chiles, then place in saucepan with water.
 * Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool.
 * Remove chiles to food processor and blend until smooth.
 * Add liquid and blend until combined.
 * Add salt and set aside.

1 package corn husks  
2/3 cup lard  
10 oz. beef broth  
2 cups masa harina  
1 tsp. baking powder  
½ tsp. salt  
1 cup sour cream  
 * Soak corn husks in warm water while making the dough.
 * Beat lard with 1 Tbsp. salt until fluffy.
 * Stir in dry ingredients, adding more broth as necessary to make a spongy dough.
 * Spread dough over corn husks to ¼ to ½ inch thickness, and place 1 Tbsp. of filling in the center of each one.
 * Fold the husks in to form a tube, and steam for 1 hour.
 * Remove tamales from husks and drizzle with remaining sauce (sour cream can be mixed in to make a creamy sauce, or served on the side).
