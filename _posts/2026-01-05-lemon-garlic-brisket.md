1/3 cup olive oil  
1 tbsp. salt  
1 tsp. pepper  
3-4 lb. brisket  
* heat oil in large dutch oven
* season brisket with salt and pepper and sear on both sides, about 5 minutes per side

juice of two lemons  
* zest one lemon and reserve for end
* add juice to pot and cook for 5 minutes, turning brisket so it can absorb juice

2 cups broth  
6 cloves garlic, minced  
* add to pot and reduce heat to low, bringing liquid to a simmer
* cover and bake at 325°F until very tender, about 3-4 hours, turning every hour

zest of one lemon  
* stir into liquid, uncover, and keep cooking for 15 minutes
* remove from juices and cool slightly before slicing against the grain
* separate fat from drippings and make sauce/gravy if desired
