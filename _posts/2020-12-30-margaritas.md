The Tequila-Forward (voted best in 538 blind tasting):

1 1/2 oz. tequila  
1/4 oz. orange liqueur  
3/4 oz. lime juice  
1/4 oz. agave nectar  
* combine all ingredients over ice and shake well
* strain into coupe

liquor.com recipe:

2 oz. tequila  
1/2 oz. orange liqueur  
1 oz. lime juice (1 lime)  
1/2 oz. agave syrup  

nytimes: same, but no agave

latest try (was not as good):

2 oz. tequila  
1 oz. orange liqueur  
1 oz. tangerine syrup  
1/2 oz. lime juice (1/2 lime)  

things to try:
* probably too little lime juice, use a whole lime
* shake with ice, then strain onto fresh ice
* maybe didn't use syrup if i was looking at nyt recipe?
* or just reduce cointreau and syrup
