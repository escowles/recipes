1½ cups lukewarm water (¾ lb.)  
1½ tsp. yeast  
¾ tsp. kosher salt  
3¼ cups flour (1 lb.)  
<ul>
 	<li>Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix until flour is incorporated into the dough.</li>
 	<li>Cover loosely and allow to rise at room temperature, 2 hours or until doubled (you can use less yeast, but rising will take longer).</li>
 	<li>Chill until ready to bake.</li>
 	<li>Cut dough in half, shape into a ball, and rest on parchment paper for 40-90 minutes (resting longer will result in more open internal structure, and reduce splitting).</li>
 	<li>Cut loaf with ¼" slices to allow even expansion, and slide into 450°F oven, adding 1 cup of hot water to a metal dish.</li>
 	<li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, until browned (remove parchment paper for last 5-10 minutes to crisp bottom).</li>
 	<li>Rest until loaf is cooled before slicing and eating.</li>
</ul>
