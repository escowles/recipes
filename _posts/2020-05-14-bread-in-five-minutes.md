1½ cups lukewarm water (¾ lb.)  
1½ tsp. yeast  
¾ tsp. kosher salt  
3¼ cups flour (1 lb.)  

  * Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix until flour is incorporated into the dough.
  * Cover loosely and allow to rise at room temperature, 2 hours or until doubled (you can use less yeast, but rising will take longer).
  * Chill until ready to bake.
  * Cut dough in half, shape into a ball, and rest on parchment paper for 40-90 minutes (resting longer will result in more open internal structure, and reduce splitting).
  * Cut loaf with ¼" slices to allow even expansion, and slide into 450°F oven, adding 1 cup of hot water to a metal dish.
  * Bake for 30-35 minutes, until browned (remove parchment paper for last 5-10 minutes to crisp bottom).
  * Rest until loaf is cooled before slicing and eating.
