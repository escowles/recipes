60ml warm milk  
10 ml (2 tsp.) yeast  
5ml (1 tsp.) sugar  
* mix together in stand mixer bowl and let yeast develop for 10 minutes

2 eggs  
1 yolk  
* beat into yeast mixture

250g flour  
30g sugar  
5g (1 tsp.) fine salt  
5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla  
* mix into yeast/egg mixture and knead with dough hook for 3 minutes

125g butter, softened  
* add 1/4 of butter at a time, kneading for 3 minutes after each addition
* increase speed to medium-high and process for 15 minutes, scraping down sides of
  the bowl every 5 minutes — the dough should have come together and be tacky but
  not stick to your fingers
* cover and proof for 1 hour, until doubled in size
* optionally, cover and chill overnight or up to 24 hours to develop flavor
* shape dough and arrange in a greased pan
  * divide dough into 3 parts and braid like challah
  * divide dough into 8 parts and add to pan in zigzag pattern
* proof dough until doubled, almost reaching the top of the pan
* brush with egg wash and bake at 325°F about 30 minutes, until reaching 190°F
