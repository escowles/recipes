2/15/2023: made these again, reducing the size and slightly increasing the ratio of cheese
to grits as part of that. when i made these last time, they were fine but not as cheezy as i had
hoped, and the batch size was too large. the updated version is a better size (9 2-3" squares) and
nicely cheezy.
