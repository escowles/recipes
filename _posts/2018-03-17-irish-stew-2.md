2 Tbsp. vegetable oil  
1/4 cup flour  
salt and pepper

  * Heat oil in a 4-quart pot.
  * If meat is too large, cut into bite-sized pieces.
  * Toss meat with flour, then season with salt and pepper.
  * Fry meat in oil until browned (a patina will form on the bottom of the pot).
  * Remove beef from pot.

1 large onion, cut in wedges  
1/2 lb. baby carrots  

  * Fry in pot until tender.

4-6 cups beef broth  
2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp. dry)  
1 lb. potatoes (about 2 medium), cubed  

  * Add remaining ingredients and beef to pot.
  * Stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to break up the patina.
  * Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer until beef is tender (2-3 hours)
  * Adjust seasoning to taste.
