## sauce:

2 Tbsp. olive oil  
1/2 onion, minced  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
1 tsp. thyme  
1/2 tsp. rosemary  
1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes  
2 jars pasta sauce (24 oz. each)
* saute veggies and herbs in oil for 5 minutes
* add pasta sauce and simmer for 1 hour

## assembly:

9 sheets no-bake lasanga noodles  
1 - 1.5 lbs. italian sausage  
* bake sausages until done and let cool. slice into coins.
* line 9x9 baking dish with 1/2 cup sauce, then top with 3 noodles overlapping
  (break off the corners to get as far as possible into the corners of the pan)
* top with a layer of sausage coins, then add 1 - 1.5 cups of sauce
* repeat layers of noodles, sausage, and sauce (but don't put sausage on the top
  layer)
* cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350Â°F for 30 minutes, then remove foil and
  bake an additional 20 minutes.
* remove from oven and rest 15 minutes before serving.

note: i adapted my regular lasagna recipe by removing the cheese. most of the 
dairy-free lasagna recipies i've found have soy or other cheese substitutes, but
i'm trying to make a lasagna without the cheese texture.
