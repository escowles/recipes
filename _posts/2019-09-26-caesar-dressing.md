2 oz. can of anchovy fillets in oil  
2 cloves garlic  
* drain anchovies and mince with garlic to make a paste

3 egg yolks  
1 tsp. dijon mustard  
juice from 1 lemon  
* whisk yolks until smooth, then whisk in mustard, lemon juice, and garlic/anchovy
  paste

2 tbsp. olive oil  
1/2 cup neutral oil  
* slowly drizzle in oils while whisking, then whisk an additional minute to thicken

1 oz. parmesan, finely grated  
pepper, to taste  
* whisk in parmesan and season with pepper
