3 peaches  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/2 tsp. lemon juice  
* peel and slice peaches, then toss with sugar and lemon juice
* rest for 30 minutes, then pulse in blender or food processor to mash the peaches
  into fine pieces (they will be hard when they freeze, so it's important they are
  not too large)
* strain to separate juices from peach chunks

4 egg yolks  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/4 tsp. salt  
* whisk in a heatproof bowl

1 1/4 cup cream  
1 cup milk
* heat until steaming, then pour into yolk mixture in a thin stream while whisking
* return milk/yolk mixture to the pot and heat to 170Â°F

1 tsp. vanilla  
* remove custard from heat and stir in vanilla and peach juices, and chill for 2 hours
* freeze in ice cream maker, adding peach chunks for last 30 seconds
