180 Cal (12x 15)

1 lb. tomatillos (about 10 small, don't use the large ones which are bitter)  
2 Jalapeno peppers (use 1 Jalapeno and 1 Chipotle for smokier salsa, or 1 Serrano and 1 Jalapeno for spicier salsa)  
1 Tbsp. lime juice  
1/4 white onion, roughly chopped  
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped  
1 tsp. salt  
1 tsp. dry cilantro  
1 cup water  

* Place tomatillos and peppers in a 4-quart saucepan and cover with water.
* Bring to boil, and continue boiling until tomatillos turn army green.
* Remove to blender and add remaining ingredients.
* Puree until smooth.  Pour into medium sauce pan and bring to slow boil.
* Omit peppers from blender to make salsa base.  Split salsa base into batches and add peppers to each batch to taste and puree separately.
