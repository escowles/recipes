7 tsp. gelatin powder (3 packets of Knox gelatine)  
1/2 cup water

* set aside while making sugar syrup

12 oz. white sugar  
1 cup corn syrup  
1/2 cup water  
* mix in a saucepan and bring to a boil
* cover pan and lower heat for 2 minutes so the condensation will dissolve sugar crystals on the

gelatin mixture  
sugar syrup    
1/4 tsp. of salt  
1 tsp. vanilla extract  
* while stand mixer is running, pour sugar syrup down side of bowl into gelatin mixture

* add vanilla and mix for 1 minute

1 Tbsp. butter  
1/4 cup powdered sugar  
1/4 cup corn starch  
* grease 8x8 pan with butter
* sift half of powdered sugar and corn starch into the pan and shake to completely coat
* reserve rest of sugar and corn starch mixture to top the marshmallows
* pour the marshmallow mixture into the pan and dust with remaining sugar and corn starch
* allow to sit uncovered for 4 hours
* turn out onto a dusted board and cut into 1" cubes, dusting with remaining sugar and corn starch
  mixture

6/8/23: Made this recipe to top smore pies, with the following modifications:

* divided recipe by 2/3 to make slightly less marshmallow
* used clear candi syrup instead of corn syrup

The result was fine but a little too tough.

For next time:
* Just make candi syrup (2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar) and don't heat above 220°F.
