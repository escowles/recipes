01/28/2023: made this as written, and it was good, but not really spicy. the 
peppercorns i used are labeled "pink peppercorns" so they are probably not sichuan.
also, frying the chicken left a large patina on the pan. next time, i would use
proper sichuan peppercorns and break up a few of the red chilies to increase the
heat a bit, and i would try deglazing the pan with the broth and/or some wine
before adding the chicken and the rest of the sauce ingredients to the pan.
