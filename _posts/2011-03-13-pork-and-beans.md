1 1/4 cups dry beans (or 2 cans of canned beans)  
* for dry beans: boil in 6 cups of water for 5 minutes, cover and soak for 1 hour, then rinse and return to
  pot with 6 cups of fresh water and simmer for 2 hours
* for canned beans: drain, rinse, and add to pot with 1 quart of chicken stock

2 tbsp. olive oil  
1 onion, chopped  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
* heat oil in a frying pan, saute onion and garlic until softened, then add to beans

1 lb. pork roast, cubed (or leftover pork)  
* for raw pork: sear in frying pan and add to beans
* for cooked pork: just add to the beans

1 bay leaf  
1 Tbsp. brown sugar  
1 tsp. thyme  
1/2 tsp. black pepper  
1 tsp. salt  
* add remaining ingredients and simmer until meat and beans are tender, approx. 1 hour, or cook in a crockpot
  for 8 hours on low

2020-10-11 23:11:23: Note: you can't just put this in the crockpot for 8 hours on low — that resulted in very
firm beans and tough meat. Simmering for 1 hour got it done.

2023-03-09: variant with canned beans and leftover pulled pork:
* replace beans with 2 cans, drained
* replace pork shoulder with 1 lb. leftover pulled pork
* saute onion and garlic in oil, then add everything to the crockpot for 6-8 hours

2024-10-01: updating main instructions to add canned beans, leftover pork, and crockpot — since that's what
i generally do these days.
