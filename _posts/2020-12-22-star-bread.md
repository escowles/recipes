**For the dough**

3/4 cup 3 tablespoons lukewarm whole milk  
240 grams all-purpose flour  
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  
2 teaspoons instant yeast (or 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast)  
1/4 teaspoon sugar  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/4 cup potato or almond flour  

**For the filling**

1 egg, beaten  
1 tablespoons dried rosemary, crushed  
1/2 cup grated romano cheese  
1 tablespoon dried thyme  
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/2 cup butter, softened  
1/4 teaspoon salt  


* Add all of the dough ingredients to a large bowl or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix to incorporate and then knead until you have a soft, smooth dough.
* Lightly grease a large bowl and place the dough in it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until the dough is almost doubled in size.
* When the dough is ready, divide it into four equal pieces and roll each piece of dough out into a 10" round.
* Place the first circle of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the surface lightly with the beaten egg, leaving 1" space around the edge.  

* Mix the cheese, dried herbs, salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl.
* Spread 1/3 of the butter in a thin layer over the egg. Sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese herb mixture over the butter.
* Place the second circle of dough on top of the filling. Repeat with the butter and mixture, top with the next circle of dough, repeat with the filling, then top with the final circle of dough.
* Trim the edges of the circles if they aren't even. Place a 2" wide circular object in the center of the top circle of dough.
* Using a very sharp knife, cut through the dough from the outer edge to the edge of the circular object. Cut 12 or 16 equal slices.
* Take two slices of dough and twist them away from each other twice. Repeat around the entire circle. Take each pair of twisted slices and press the ends together firmly to seal the dough.
* Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 15 minutes, while you preheat the oven to 400F.
* Brush the top of the loaf with beaten egg and bake it for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
* Let cool slightly before serving.
