2020-04-30 13:24:22: NYT comment on traditional Teriyaki (at this recipe:
<https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012984-chicken-teriyaki>):

* 4 TBSP soy sauce
* 2 TBSP mirin
* 2 TBSP sugar
* 2 TBSP rice vinegar (do not use sushi vinegar)
* some grated ginger

As you pan-fry the chicken you add the above ingredients and cook till all liquid is
reduced. THAT'S IT. The ratio is soy (1TBSP per serving) = mirin + sugar. Add
vinegar that's 1/2 of soy. I grew up in Japan - this is the ratio everyone (or at
least the majority) uses there.
