8/4/24: made this tonight, but didn't have any mayo so wound up adapting a baked
chicken recipe instead for the chicken (which used olive oil). the potatoes wound up
being a cross of french fries and roasted potatoes, and a little too oily. next time,
i hope using the mayo recipe will avoid it being too oily. but i would also put the
potatoes in 15 minutes early instead of 10, to get them a little crispier.
