1.5 lbs. chicken breast  
1/2 cup plain yogurt  
1 clove garlic, minced  
2 tsp. ground ginger  
1 tsp garam masala  
1/2 tsp. turmeric  
1/2 tsp. cumin  
1/2 tsp. red chili powder  
1/2 tsp. salt  

  * Cube chicken and toss with remaining ingredients
  * Marinate at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight

2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 Tbsp. butter  
1/2 large onion, sliced or chopped  
1 clove garlic, minced  
1 1/2 tsp. ginger  
3/4 tsp. cumin  
1/2 tsp. garam masala  
1/2 tsp. coriander  
7 oz (200 g) crushed tomatoes  
1/2 tsp. red chili powder  
1/2 tsp. salt (or to taste)  
1/2 cup heavy cream  
1/2 tsp. maple syrup  

* Heat oil and brown chicken pieces in batches, then remove from heat and cover
* Add butter to the pan, and saute onions until they soften (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.
* Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
* Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red color.
* Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.
* Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream and maple syrup through the sauce. Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.
