2¼ cups cream  
¾ cup milk  
½ cup sugar  
3 yolks  
¾ tsp. cinnamon  

  * Combine cream, milk, and sugar in medium saucepan, and heat over medium-low heat until reaching 160°F
  * Beat yolks in a heatproof, non-skid bowl, then pour cream mixture into the yolks in a thin stream while stirring.
  * Return mixture to the saucepan, and heat 8-10 minutes until slightly thickened (coat the back of a metal spoon, swipe a stripe with your finger, and the edge will keep its well-defined edge).
  * Add cinnamon and reduce heat to low. Continue heating for a total of 15 minutes, breaking up cinnamon clumps with a whisk as needed.
  * Cool to room temperature, then chill.  Freeze in ice cream maker according to directions.
