1 lb. crabmeat   
4 crushed crackers (1/3 cup)  
3 green onions, finely chopped   
1/2 bell pepper, finely chopped  
1/4 cup mayonnaise   
1 egg  
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce   
1 tsp. regular mustard  
1/2 lemon, juiced   
2 cloves garlic, minced   
1 tsp. salt (20 grinds)  
1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper   
1/4 cup flour for dusting   
1/2 cup oil for frying  

* In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients, except for the flour and peanut oil.
* Shape 1/4 cup portions into patties and dust with flour.
* Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When oil is hot, carefully place crab cakes, in batches, in pan and fry until browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.
