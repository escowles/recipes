01/21/2026: made this yesterday and it was great (i made a couple of modifications
like skipping mushrooms and adding some worcestershire to make up for the lost
umami). i also used a smaller camembert round, which made the assembly not work as
well as it should (making a mound instead of a stack). next time, i will make layers,
with the brussels on the bottom, then cheese, then onion jam, and finally the squash,
to make stacking work better.
