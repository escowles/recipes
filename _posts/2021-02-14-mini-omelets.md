5 eggs  
6 egg whites  
1/2 cup cream  
salt, pepper, and chipotle powder

* beat eggs, whites, and cream until eggs are broken down
* whisk in salt, pepper, and chipotle, and set aside

various toppings (bacon, sausage crumbles, cheese, spinach, onions, peppers, etc.)  
* saute toppings as usual, tending towards undercooking
* grease muffin pan and fill each muffin well with toppings as desired (it's easy to
  make variations for different people here)
* pour 1/3 cup of egg mixture over fillings, leaving a little headspace in muffin
  wells
* bake at 350Â°F for 20 minutes
* rest 5 minutes (it's normal for them to deflate), then remove from muffin tin
