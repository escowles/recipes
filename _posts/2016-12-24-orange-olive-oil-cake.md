¾ cup olive oil  
1½ large navel oranges  
1½ large eggs (2 medium eggs)  
1¼ cups sugar  
¾ cup milk  
1¼ cups flour  
¼ tsp. baking powder  
¼ tsp. baking soda  
¼ tsp. salt  

  * Zest the oranges, then trim skin and pith from the orange and slice into thin round slices; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
  * Whisk zest and eggs until well blended, then whisk in 1 cup of the sugar.
  * Beat on medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until very light.
  * Mix on low speed while adding olive oil and milk.
  * In a separate bowl, mix together the remaining sugar, and other dry ingredients. Add to liquids in three additions, whisking until smooth after each addition.
  * Grease a 9" cake pan with olive oil, then line the bottom with parchment paper.
  * Pour batter into pan and bake at 350°F for 50 to 55 minutes, until the cake is well risen, golden, and firm in the center when pressed with a fingertip.
  * Remove to a cooling rack for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the edge to loosen, and turn out onto a plate and return to the cooling rack right side up.
  * Cool completely and serve with orange slices, plus whipped cream or ice cream as desired.
