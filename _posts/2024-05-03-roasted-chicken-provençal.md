05/07/2024: made this last night and it was quite good, but with a few flaws:
* not enough liquid to braise as directed
* too many shallots and they were charred (related to the liquid)
* using a 9x12" pan, there was not enough space
* not much lemon flavor

updating the recipe to address those issues.
