<h2>Mash</h2>
<ul>
	<li data-canvas-width="517.2973978358823">Heat 1 quart of water per pound of grain to 180°F and add to mash tun/cooler.</li>
	<li>Let stand 10 minutes, check temperature until it falls to 170°F.</li>
	<li>Add grain slowly and mix well, cover and let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="552.570416037647">Check temperature, which should be between 149°F and 156°F.</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="493.2460840091175">Replace lid and let stand for 1 hour or as directed by recipe.</li>
	<li>Heat enough sparge water for boil size to 200°F in kettle.</li>
	<li>Remove a sample of wort to a white saucer, and a drop of iodine.  
<ul>
	<li>If it quickly disappears or remains red, the mash is complete</li>
	<li>If it turns black, the mash is incomplete. Re-test every 10 minutes until iodine does not turn black.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wort Collection</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Collect 2 quarts of wort and pour back on top of mash until it is free of grain or cloudiness.</li>
	<li>Slowly collect wort in fermenting bucket (for accurate measurement) while pouring 200°F sparge water over mashed grains.</li>
	<li>Add sparge water at the same rate as wort collection, to keep grain submerged.  
<ul>
	<li>Wort collection should take about 1 hour to get correct gravity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="507.68259284794107">When 5 gallons of wort are collected and the kettle is empty, pour wort into kettle and collect final 2 gallons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Boil</h2>
<ul>
	<li data-canvas-width="499.35863177294095">Bring wort to boil. Add hops and other kettle additions:  
<ul>
	<li data-canvas-width="321.89110075264705">60 minutes bittering hops</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="445.7130119458823">15 minutes flavor hops and Irish Moss</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="462.2512969117647">5 minutes aroma hops and wort chiller</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="492.5793157738236">Check gravity and dilute to specified original gravity.</li>
	<li>Chill wort until temperature falls to room temperature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fermentation</h2>
<ul>
	<li data-canvas-width="485.559203745294">Siphon bitter wort to sterile fermenting bucket.</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="485.559203745294">Pitch yeast, stir well and seal lid with airlock.</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="485.559203745294">The airlock should show bubbling about 24 hours after pitching yeast.</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="485.559203745294">After a few days, bubbling should slow down to an occasional bubble.</li>
	<li data-canvas-width="485.559203745294">Check gravity every day, and bottle when final gravity is reached, or when gravity stops falling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bottling</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use a <a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/learn/resources/priming-sugar-calculator/">priming sugar calculator</a> to figure out how much sugar to use</li>
	<li>Dissolve priming sugar in 2 cups of water and boil for 5 minutes, then cool to room temperature.</li>
	<li>Add sugar solution to bottling bucket and then siphon beer to bottling bucket.  
<ul>
	<li>If not using a bottling bucket, add sugar solution to beer, stir gently, and let beer sit for 30 minutes to settle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Siphon beer to sterile bottles and cap.  Let sit at room temperature for 2 weeks to carbonate.</li>
</ul>
