<h2>Mash</h2>

* Heat 1 quart of water per pound of grain to 180°F and add to mash tun/cooler.
* Let stand 10 minutes, check temperature until it falls to 170°F.
* Add grain slowly and mix well, cover and let stand for 10 minutes.
*Check temperature, which should be between 149°F and 156°F.
* Replace lid and let stand for 1 hour or as directed by recipe.
* Heat enough sparge water for boil size to 200°F in kettle.
* Remove a sample of wort to a white saucer, and a drop of iodine.  
  * If it quickly disappears or remains red, the mash is complete
  * If it turns black, the mash is incomplete. Re-test every 10 minutes until iodine does not turn black.

<h2>Wort Collection</h2>

* Collect 2 quarts of wort and pour back on top of mash until it is free of grain or cloudiness.
* Slowly collect wort in fermenting bucket (for accurate measurement) while pouring 200°F sparge water over mashed grains.
* Add sparge water at the same rate as wort collection, to keep grain submerged.  
* Wort collection should take about 1 hour to get correct gravity.
* When 5 gallons of wort are collected and the kettle is empty, pour wort into kettle and collect final 2 gallons.

<h2>Boil</h2>

* Bring wort to boil. Add hops and other kettle additions:  
  * 60 minutes bittering hops
  * 15 minutes flavor hops and Irish Moss
  * 5 minutes aroma hops and wort chiller
* Check gravity and dilute to specified original gravity.
* Chill wort until temperature falls to room temperature.

<h2>Fermentation</h2>

* Siphon bitter wort to sterile fermenting bucket.
* Pitch yeast, stir well and seal lid with airlock.
* The airlock should show bubbling about 24 hours after pitching yeast.
* After a few days, bubbling should slow down to an occasional bubble.
* Check gravity every day, and bottle when final gravity is reached, or when gravity stops falling.

<h2>Bottling</h2>

* Use a [priming sugar calculator](http://www.northernbrewer.com/learn/resources/priming-sugar-calculator/) to figure out how much sugar to use
* Dissolve priming sugar in 2 cups of water and boil for 5 minutes, then cool to room temperature.
* Add sugar solution to bottling bucket and then siphon beer to bottling bucket.  
* If not using a bottling bucket, add sugar solution to beer, stir gently, and let beer sit for 30 minutes to settle.
* Siphon beer to sterile bottles and cap.  Let sit at room temperature for 2 weeks to carbonate.
