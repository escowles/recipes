9/29/23: made these yesterday and they were deeply weird — almost completely black
instead of chocolate brown. i suspect they need a fair bit more butter and flour.

9/30/23: Andrea sent me her recipe, so i'm switching to that

4/21/24: these were way to cakey and dry — not sure if i did something wrong or
if Andrea has a different idea of what brownies should be like.
