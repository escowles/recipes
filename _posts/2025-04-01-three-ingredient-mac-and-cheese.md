8 oz. pasta  
3 cups water  
salt  
* add pasta to a large pot and add just enough water to cover
* bring to a simmer, stirring frequently, until water has been mostly absored and
  pasta is al dente (use the minimum time from the package as a rough guide)

1/2 cup. cream or evaporated milk  
8 oz. cheddar or other melting cheese  
pepper, to taste  
* add cream and return to a simmer
* add cheese and mix until melted and saucy, about 2 minutes longer
* season with pepper (and other spices like garlic powder, nutmeg, and chipotle
  power) to taste

4/6/25: made this for lunch, and it worked out great with meatballs and green beans.
