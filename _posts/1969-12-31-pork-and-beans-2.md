2020-10-11 23:11:23: Note: you can't just put this in the crockpot for 8 hours on low â€” that resulted in very firm beans and tough meat. Simmering for 1 hour got it done.

2023-03-09: variant with canned beans and leftover pulled pork:
* replace beans with 2 cans, drained
* replace pork shoulder with 1 lb. leftover pulled pork
* saute onion and garlic in oil, then add everything to the crockpot for 6-8 hours
