* This made two very thin cakes
* When I checked them at 20 minutes, they were still liquid in the middle. But at 26
  minutes, they were done.
* I did not put parchment under them, and I had to loosen the sides with a spatula,
  and then scrape under the edge all the way around, before they would come out of
  the cake pans.
