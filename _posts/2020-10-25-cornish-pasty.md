Note: apparently steak and rutabaga are traditional, but all the pasties I've had were ground beef and carrots, so that's what I'm using.

2020-10-27 22:07:35: 7" is very small (about 1/4 cup of filling), and the filling
recipe makes at least three times as much filling as four pasties need. Next time I
think I'll triple the crust recipe and make 6-8 larger pasties.

These were also pretty dry. The recipe called for dusting with flour and topping with
pats of butter (I did the flour and skipped the butter). So I could just follow the
recipe next time, or add some chicken stock to make the filling more moist. I also
think that adding more salt, and some herbs could go a long way to make the flavor
richer.

**01/02/2023**: tried some modifications to address the issues from 10/27/2020:
* made 1.5x the dough
* reduced onion and carrot to 6 oz.
* used 90/10 ground beef, but forgot the butter again
* used 2 tsp. salt, 3/4 tsp. black pepper, 1/4 tsp. white pepper, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg,
  1/2 tsp. thyme, and 1/4 tsp. coriander
* the dough was an even multiple of 3, so i made three large pasties, rolled out to
  about 9-10", and used 1 1/3 cups filling
* i shaped the filling into a log in the middle of the dough disc, and folded the
  sides up like a taco, and sealed on top (squishing filling in to be able to close
  the top, which let me get a lot more filling in)

the resulting pasties were better, but still had some issues:
* they were much too large, should make at least 4, and 6 would probably be best
* they leaked juices, so adding another Tbsp. of flour would probably help, and 
  the butter is definitely not needed (unless using super lowfat beef or lean steak)
* the nutmeg was too much, and the salt level was a little low, so i would do one
  tbsp. of salt, and no nutmeg
