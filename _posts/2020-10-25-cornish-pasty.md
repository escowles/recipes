Note: apparently steak and rutabaga are traditional, but all the pasties I've had were ground beef and carrots, so that's what I'm using.

2020-10-27 22:07:35: 7" is very small (about 1/4 cup of filling), and the filling
recipe makes at least three times as much filling as four pasties need. Next time I
think I'll triple the crust recipe and make 6-8 larger pasties.

These were also pretty dry. The recipe called for dusting with flour and topping with
pats of butter (I did the flour and skipped the butter). So I could just follow the
recipe next time, or add some chicken stock to make the filling more moist. I also
think that adding more salt, and some herbs could go a long way to make the flavor
richer.
