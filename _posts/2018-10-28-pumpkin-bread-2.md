12/05/21: Made with 1 tsp. of baking soda, and it was good but very moist and too
dense. Should probably try 1-2 tsp. of baking powder instead, since pumpkin is
probably not acidic enough to fully activate baking soda. I also noticed that this
recipe has a lower flour-to-liquids ratio than my trusty banana bread recipe, so
upping flour to 1.5 cups would also be good.
