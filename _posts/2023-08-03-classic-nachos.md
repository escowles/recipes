6 oz. tortilla chips  
8 oz. colby cheese  
1/2 cup sliced pickled jalapenos  
1-2 Tbsp. brine  
* spread chips on baking sheet and sprinkle with cheese
* top with jalapenos and sprinkle brine over chips
* bake at 400°F for 5 to 7 minutes, until cheese is melted and starts to brown

note: these are the original, elemental nachos — feel free to add additional toppings (e.g. black
beans or taco meat before the cheese, or tomatoes and green onions after baking).
