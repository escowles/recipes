8/27/2025: made this yesterday, with a few modifications:
* cubed pork shoulder instead of ham hocks (wegmans only had raw pork hocks)
* canned great northern beans (couldn't find dry navy beans)
* 4 cups of water instead of 8 (because 4 filled my crockpot)

with these updates, it's pretty similar to [pork and beans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-03-13-pork-and-beans %}) — but the spices are a little different, so i think it's
worth keeping both of them, at least until i decide which one i like best or if they
are different enough.
