01/28/2023: made this last week and it was fine, but sous-videing the salmon made
it more cooked in texture than raw. it was also pretty monolithic as a meal. i
combined the leftovers with orzo to make a pasta salad that was well-received. next
time i would plan on that, and just use canned salmon for convenience and cost.
