04/24/2025: i accidentally skipped the onion, and it was completely fine without it,
so i'm marking it optional. also, noticed the recipe had changed significantly to
have a lot of tomato juice instead of using all fresh tomatoes, and have directions
to leave it chunky. i think it's better to use all tomatoes, and you can make it as
chunky or smooth as you want. 30 seconds on high in a vitamix will make it perfectly
smooth and completely emulsify the olive oil, which i quite like.
