67g sugar  
1 Tbsp. instant yeast  
1 1/4 tsp. kosher salt  
2 eggs  
57g butter  
57g lukewarm water (110°F)  
1 tsp. vanilla  
1/4 tsp. orange extract

100g dried cherries  
66g dried pineapple, chopped (or 100g [candied orange peel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-12-10-cranberry-orange-cinnamon-rolls %}#candied-orange-peel))  
zest from one clementine  
* turn dough out onto floured board and knead in fruits and zest
* shape dough into a ball and place in a straight-sided 2-quart pan lined with
  baking parchment (a 2-quart saucepan will do)

* bake on lower rack at 400°F for 10 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375°F for
  another 10 minutes, then 350°F for 25-35 minutes, until a thermometer reads 190°F.

12/23/2024: made an all-orange variant this year:
* replaced dried fruit with candied orange peel from [cranberry orange cinnamon rolls]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-12-10-cranberry-orange-cinnamon-rolls %})
* did not have orange extract, so used zest from two oranges

the candied orange was great, but it was a little too much zest (1 orange and having
orange extract would be better)
