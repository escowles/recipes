4 tbsp. butter  
3 cloves garlic, smashed or sliced  
1 tbsp. thyme  
1 1/2 cups chicken stock

* in oven-proof skillet, heat oil/fat over high heat
* season potatoes with salt and pepper and sear in a single layer without disturbing
  for 4-5 minutes, until browned
* continue cooking for 3-4 minutes, rotating as needed for even browning
* flip potatoes to other side, add butter, and cook for 1 minute
* add garlic and thyme and cook for 1 minute

06/03/2024: this was a recommendation from TomV, and just like he said, they were
fantastic. next time, i will make a couple of small changes, though:
* i cut the potatoes a little too thinly (1" instead of 1 1/2") and so couldn't fit
  all of the pieces in a 12" frying pan
* the sauce did not thicken into a gravy, so next time i will probably try making a
  flour or cornstarch mix and thickening it (rather than using gelatin like the
  original recipe asks for)
* i grabbed the pan handle with my bare hand without thinking about it being hot
  from the oven, so i will put a potholder on it or something to remind me
