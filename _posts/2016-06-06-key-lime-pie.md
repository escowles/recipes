8 tsp. lime zest (approx. 4)  
1 cup lime juice (approx. 6)  
8  egg yolks  
2 (14 oz.) cans sweetened condensed milk  

* Grate lime zest, then halve limes and juice.
* Beat lime zest into egg yolks until greenish.
* Whisk in sweetened condensed milk and juice until smooth.
* Set aside while making the crust.

11 full sized graham crackers  
3 Tbsp. granulated sugar  
5 Tbsp. butter  

* Put graham crackers and sugar in food processor and process until broken down into small even crumbs.
* Melt butter, add to crumbs, and mix until combined.
* Pour buttered crumbs into 9" pie dish and press into sides and bottom to form a crust.
* Bake empty crust at 325° F for 13 minutes.
* Add filling and bake an additional 15-30 minutes, until pie is set and barely wiggles in the center.
* Chill to room temperature and then refrigerate for 3 hours.

1 pint heavy whipping cream  
confectioners’ sugar (about ¼ cup, but mainly just to taste)  

* Combine cream and sugar and beat until thickened.

2018-02-11 02:09:03: Dairy-free filling idea:
* 4 yolks
* 2 limes zest + 3 limes juice
* 1 can coconut cream
* 3 tbsp. honey

2018-03-03 15:17:52: Mini variant:
* Add 1 Tbsp. of crust mixture to each well of a wrapper-lined muffin pan.
* Compact each mini-crust with the bottom of a glass.
* Pre-bake 5 minutes at 350°F, then cool on a wire rack.
* Fill with 1/4 cup of filling and bake 12-15 minutes at 350°F, until set.

2021-01-14 Orange variant:
* Replace lime juice and zest with equal parts lemon and navel orange.
* Produced a very mellow pie — maybe using a more sour orange and/or grapefruit juice would
  be better, and more like sour orange pie?
