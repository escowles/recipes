2018-02-11 02:09:03: Dairy-free filling idea:
* 4 yolks
* 2 limes zest + 3 limes juice
* 1 can coconut cream
* 3 tbsp. honey

2018-03-03 15:17:52: Mini variant:
* Add 1 Tbsp. of crust mixture to each well of a wrapper-lined muffin pan.
* Compact each mini-crust with the bottom of a glass.
* Pre-bake 5 minutes at 350°F, then cool on a wire rack.
* Fill with 1/4 cup of filling and bake 12-15 minutes at 350°F, until set.

2021-01-14 Orange variant:
* Replace lime juice and zest with equal parts lemon and navel orange.
* Produced a very mellow pie — maybe using a more sour orange and/or grapefruit juice would
  be better, and more like sour orange pie?
