2 cups heavy cream  
1 cup whole milk  
1/4 tsp. salt  
6 eggs  
2/3 cup sugar  
2 Tbsp. matcha (powdered tea)  

Bring cream, milk and salt to a simmer and immediately remove from heat.
Whisk eggs, sugar and matcha and slowly add cream mixture while whisking vigorously.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until thick enough to coat back of a wooden spoon and 160F.
Poor through fine sieve into metal bowl and cool, stirring occasionally.  Place bowl in ice bath to cool quickly.  Chill covered until cold, at least 1 hour.
Freeze in ice cream maker, then freeze in airtight container to harden.

Can use mortar and pestle to pulverize pearl tea.  Slightly less than 2 Tbsp. of pearl tea makes 2 Tbsp. of powder.
