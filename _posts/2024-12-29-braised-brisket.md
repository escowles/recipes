1 clove of garlic, halved  
2 tbsp. olive oil  
* unwrap brisket and pat dry with paper towels
* rub all over with garlic
* score fat cap in a criss-cross pattern

4 celery stalks, chopped  
3 cloves garlic, crushed

1 bay leaf  
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  
1 tbsp. thyme

01/02/2025: i made this a few nights ago and it was a bit of a rigamarole, because
i don't have a dish large enough for a whole brisket that can sear/boil on the
stovetop and then go in the oven. so i wound up searing the brisket in a frying pan
by rotating it and hanging it over the edge to get each half, then sauteeing the 
veggies separately and combining it all in a 9x13" glass baking dish. all that said,
it was very tender and flavorful. so i look forward to making changes to the veggies
and spices to bend it more towards bbq. the other difference between this dish and
when i have smoked briskets is that i had a whole usda choice brisket, which i don't
see generally. so it might make sense to wait for jewish holidays when i can find
better quality cuts to try to smoke brisket again.
