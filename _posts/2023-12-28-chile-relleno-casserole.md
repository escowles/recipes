01/04/2023: made this with a few changes (made two 5" pot-pie sized portions instead
of a whole casserole, added more spices to the meat (chipotle powder and garlic
powder). it was ok, but hard to eat (because of the large slab of poblano on the
bottom) and less flavorful than i was hoping, with the batter overwhelming the meat,
cheese, and peppers, making it more like a quiche. also, even the 5" pot-pie
portions were too much.

next time:
* make muffin-tin portions
* dice all the peppers and mix them and the cheese into the meat
* taste the filling and make sure it has enough salt and spice
* go easy on the batter to keep them meatier
