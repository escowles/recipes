* reduce heat and cover, simmering for 20-25 minutes until rice is tender and
  has soaked up excess moisture

**note:** i used 2 1/2 cups water and didn't drain the tomatoes, and it was too
much moisture. the recipe as written above may be a little dry, so needs monitoring
to make sure there's enough liquid for the rice
