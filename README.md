# esm√©'s recipes
this is a jekyll blog hosting my recipes:

<https://escowles.github.io/recipes/>

these recipes are mostly things i've found on the web (generally at least abbreviated
and often substantially tweaked). there are also some old standards from cookbooks
(cook's illustrated is my go-to, but also betty crocker, silver spoon, and a bunch of
more specialized cookbooks). and there are a handful of family recipes too.

i used to manage these in a private wordpress blog, and copy them over to
<a href="https://knittles.ticklefish.org/">knittles & beer</a> when i wanted to share
them. but that increasingly just seemed like a lot of bother, so i decided that i'd
put them all in one public place.

# terse recipes
i know it's not for everyone, but these recipes are very terse. they assume you know
how to cook, and if you're not familiar with a technique, i'd recommend finding a
more standard explanation somewhere else. these are the recipes i cook from every day,
and i like them to be terse so more fits on my tablet screen and i don't have to
scroll around and wade through verbiage to find the number i need to find in a hurry.
